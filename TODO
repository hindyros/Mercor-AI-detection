- Train on hardest subset (subset selection problem)
- Implement OCT-H and see if it does betetr than XGBoost
- Train a DNN for prediction, etc. 
- Use text embeddings on top of tabluar data (multimodality)
- Make some kind of prescription? 
- Make model more sparse? Regularize it ! Try and know why a text is detected to be AI and not real text
- Maybe we can enrich the dataset by generating more AI-text and get more human generated Q&A from other data sources
