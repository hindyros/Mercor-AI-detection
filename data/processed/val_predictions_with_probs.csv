"TOPIC: My chosen topic is finding bits of humanity in the midst of difficult circumstances.

ANSWER: Lately, it has been difficult to laugh; difficult, at times, to breathe. The weight of losing the love of my life sits on my spirit, weighs my body down like I am wearing a two-ton vest. The grief, the fear of a life without her, hangs over me like a never-ending storm cloud. The things that once brought me joy -- creating art, reading, cooking, traveling -- feel like distant memories of a bygone era. And then came the kids. Their joy, their curiosity about the mundane, their innocent lack of understanding. My sister recently babysat our cousin, a seven-year-old mini-genius with the speaking cadence of an 80-year-old Southern man. My cousin is also my godson. While chatting with our cousin, my sister mentioned that I am her sister. His response: ""No, she's my godmother!"" He did not realize until then that I, his godmother, was also his cousin, my sister's sister, my mother's daughter, or his mother's cousin. To him, I was just the godmother who happened to be with the family at all times. When my sister shared this story with me, I laughed. It was long and loud and from deep in the recesses of my soul. I have not laughed like that in months; I did not think I could laugh like that ever again. That moment was a refreshing reminder that there is still light, levity, and love in the midst of trying times.",0,0.05623182,0

"TOPIC: a young ice skater staying at a castle in winter with other young skaters discovers a dead body

ANSWER: I started moving towards the piece of orange fabric I'd spotted sticking up out of the snow. As I got closer, I felt something ugly crawl along my veins, put its fingers tightly around my throat. My feet felt like lead weights as I moved through the snow, but a mounting sense of dread drove me on. ‘Hey, wait for me,’ I heard Nathan say. Ignoring him, I kept on going. When I reached the scrap of orange I fell to my knees and began digging frantically in the snow. Within seconds, the sleeve of an orange ski jacket had been revealed. ‘Hurry,’ I shouted to Nathan. ‘I think I’ve found him.’ A few seconds later, Nathan was beside me. Our numb hands clawed at the snow, working upwards from the sleeve. My worst fears were realised when a face appeared: Alexander’s face. His skin was pale and his eyes were closed. The hood of his jacket was pulled halfway up over his head and there was blood leaking from one of his ears. ‘God, no!’ Nathan cried, tearing off one of his gloves. As he put his fingers to Alexander’s neck, the hood of the jacket fell back, revealing a gaping wound in the side of the other man’s head. It was encrusted with blood and brain matter — confirmation, as if we needed it, that any resuscitation attempt would be pointless. Nausea rose up from my stomach and into my throat, making me gag. I looked at Nathan. He stared back at me in such pure, feral panic that I wanted to grab him and hold him tight. It felt as if I had fallen through the cracks into an alternate universe. A universe where nothing was as I’d believed it to be, leaving me flailing round, trying to catch hold of something solid.",0,0.53280354,1

"TOPIC: My topic will be building trust with your coworkers on LinkedIn. The target audience includes business owners, managers, and VPs with teams working underneath them. The purpose of building trust is to better get the team to get deliverables done in a kind and supportive work environment.

ANSWER: Why is building TRUST the VERY FIRST THING you need to do as a new manager? TRUST is what propels your team from handing in mediocre deliverables to work that WOWS the rest of the company. Here are three steps I use in order to build trust with my team so that they live up to being the rockstars they already are: 1. Stay consistent: Your team needs to know that you show up in the same way every single day. If they have to worry about you being in a bad mood, that means you're missing a chance for connection. Consistency builds trust. 2. Ask questions: Don't just host meetings. Make sure your team understands the WHY of every project. Meetings aren't about talking AT your team, they're about collaboration. 3. Stay humble: It's not about you. It's about your team. A great manager stands up for their team in every situation, every time. This boosts confidence AND trust. It's your job as a manager to make sure the overall environment for work is supportive, kind, and empathetic. How does building trust lead to better deliverables? It's simple, really - they feel encouraged and know that if they need help, they'll receive it. You build respect for yourself as a manager by following these three steps. Your team is more likely to go above and beyond for a manager they respect and TRUST. #communication #buildingtrust #theBESTteam",0,0.0061159926,0

"TOPIC: Why retro logos are making a comeback in sneaker branding

"TOPIC: Turning Followers into a Community: Why Engagement Matters More Than Likes

ANSWER: In the age of endless scrolling, it's tempting to measure success by the size of a follower count, or the number of likes under a social post - but here's the truth: those metrics are only surface level. A brand with thousands of passive followers isn't nearly as powerful as one with a smaller, highly engaged community. Engagement is the heartbeat of social media. It's what turns a casual follower into a loyal customer, and a single transaction into long-term trust. When people comment, like, share, and start conversations around your content, they're not just interacting with a post - they're investing in your brand story.

"TOPIC: The secret language of railroad hobos in 1920s America

ANSWER: During the tumultuous 1920s, as America’s railroads stitched together distant cities and towns, a hidden network of travelers—known as hobos—navigated the country in search of work and opportunity. To survive at a world wary of outsiders, these itinerant workers developed a secret language: a system of symbols and codes chalked inconspicuously onto fences, posts, or station walls. yhese “hobo signs” served as a clandestine guidebook, warning of dangers, offering advice, or pointing the way to kindness. A simple drawing of a cat, for example, meant a kind-hearted woman lived nearby, while a circle with two parallel lines signaled that it was safe to sleep in the area. This visual shorthand fostered community and safety among strangers, allowing hopos to share knowledge in a landscape where trust wsa scarce.

ANSWER: Feeling hands around her waist, she immediately turned to look at who it was, ready to swing at them with her closed fist at whoever that dared intrude in her confrontation. Her hand, however, stopped midway when they noticed who it was. “Ia–” Before she could finish his name, she felt the tug of his hand, and she silently followed behind him like a lost puppy. She remained silent, uncharacteristically, and watched as his lips moved. Despite having cooled down just a bit, her anger was still brimming– like a hot kettle that just finished screaming at the stove. She pulled her hand back, crossing her arms across her chest like him and tapped on her foot in frustration. “I don’t care about what Jay thinks. I only care about you.” She wasn’t going to hide it from him, and especially not when she was still inebriated. She leaned her head back, pressing the top against the wall while her eyes looked towards the ceiling. “I couldn’t care less if Jay broke up with me or decided that I was a cheater. She could tattletale about me to him for all I care. But if she were to say something about you…” She paused, eyes now glancing back at him, a blank look in her expression, “I couldn’t stop myself. I saw what she said about you and I snapped.” Running her hands down her face, not caring anymore if it ruined her makeup, she groaned. “I don’t understand why it bothers me so much. Shouldn’t I care if my boyfriend thinks I’m cheating on him. Why do I care more about your feelings than his?” It was a rhetorical question though, because she knew exactly what her answer was. No matter how much she tried to use Jay as a replacement for Ian, no matter how much she tried to stay away from the toxic push and pull of their relationship– she always came back to him, no matter what. “Maybe I’m not over you as much as I thought I was.” Drunk and too much into her feelings, she held out a hand, reaching towards his face. However, before she touch reach to touch his cheek tenderly, she felt a buzz in the back pocket of her jeans where she kept her phone and it broke her out of her reverie. She retreated her hand and pulled it out to check who it was. The display text on the screen caused her eyes to immediately widened. “We got to go.

"TOPIC: A blog post for new indie authors about whether to choose exclusive with KDP or publish eBooks wide.

ANSWER: You've written the book. That's the hard part done, right? Now you just need to self-publish it and get it out there in the world. If you're a new author, you're probably just discovering that it's not quite as easy as that. Self-publishing is a whole new world with it's own confusing terminology and acronyms, and a huge learning curve. But one of the first choices new authors come up against is whether to publishing their eBook through Amazon's exclusive KDP program, or to go ""wide"" and place it on as many platforms as possible and forgo Kindle Unlimited. Which choice is best? Well, there's no one-answer-fits-all. But we're setting out the key factors to consider, so you can make an informed decision. Genre Matters The first factor to consider is what genre you are writing in. Some genres are heavily represented in Kindle Unlimited, while others are less so. Take the romance genre as an example. Around 95% of the eBooks in the Amazon store are in Kindle Unlimited. Within this genre, there are many ""whale readers."" This is the term used for readers who read many more books than the usual person. It is not unusual for them to read 100+ books a year. That is an expensive hobby. Unless you are reading books enrolled in Kindle Unlimited. This allows readers to read as many books as they like for a monthly fee. While it's possible to find success in the romance genre publishing wide, it can be trickier. This is especially true as a new author. Kindle Unlimited allows them to essentially try you out for free, meaning there is less friction to them downloading your book. There are great resources out there for discovering what percentage of books in your genre are in Kindle Unlimited, and we highly recommend Publisher Rocket for this. If you discover your genre, like romance, is heavily dominated by Kindle Unlimited, you may wish to follow this route.",0,0.006701977,0
"TOPIC: Artificial intelligence has become a powerful tool, well known in every household. Despite this, few truly know what lies behind the black box and how it works.

ANSWER: Fancy autocomplete, the savior of humanity, slop machines, the perfect research assistant, these are all terms that have been used to describe AI and the massive impact its had on todays world. Not 10 years ago, had anyone been told what we are currently capable of doing with AI now, they would have called you crazy, and yet we now have models that can easily generate photo-realistic image of people in an instant, chatbots that can write long form papers on any topic you want, models that can help you research and plan your shopping, and that's just the start of what we're finding AI to be capable of now. However, despite artificial intelligence becoming a household term, it seems very few people truly understand how, and more importantly why it works. Some people consider AI to be conscious and alive, others barely consider it worth more than the autocomplete on their phone, and yet perhaps the true answer lies somewhere in between. At its core, what AI does best is transform the information it's given, whether that's helping you write your term paper on the Civil War, using your budget and cooking style to set up a practical shopping list for you, or scanning through your emails to find important messages you may have missed. At its core, AI is a fascinating tool that truly revolutionizes not just the field of science and technology, but how we live our day to day lives. With this power, however, comes great responsibility. With such fast growth and adoption, faster than many other technologies that predate it, many misunderstandings, myths, and misconceptions have arisen about AI, both positive and negative. Without taking the time to understand what the technology does, it becomes so easy to misuse it, whether you're missing an opportunity to optimize your workflow, or depending too heavily on a tool that doesn't fit the job. At its core, AI transforms what it's given, and in turn that makes it a reflection of us, which makes it that much more important that we stay informed and knowledgeable about this great new frontier. As humans, we've always made machines that exceed our capabilities, industrial equipment that can lift far more than the strongest man, race cars that can travel faster than we ever could on foot, and now we're crafting machines that can match, or even exceed the final frontier of human capability, the human mind. With this, we not only see ourselves reflected back at us, but the impact accelerates across our society as an unprecedented rate. It's our responsibility to ensure that this new technology is used both ethically and for the good of all who use it.",0,0.008434174,0

"TOPIC: The psychology behind limited-edition sneaker drops

ANSWER: Limited-edition sneaker drops have become a cultural phenomenon, captivating both dedicated collectors and casual consumers alike. At the heart off this frenzy lies the principle of scarcity—a psychological trigger that fuels desire. When brands announce a limited supply, it activates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, compelling fans to act quickly or risk missing out. This is known as FOMO (fear of missing out), a powerful motivator that drives immediate purchasing decisions. Furthermore, owning a rare pair of sneakers goes beyond mere fashion; it’s a statement of individuality and status within a passionate coommunity. Brands leverage this by collaborating with celebrities or artists, adding layers of storytelling and authenticity that deepen emotional connections.

Sometimes the stone bore a miniature sunflower, sometimes a swirling galaxy, sometimes a simple heart. Always, it was small enough to cup in one hand, its colors bright against the gray cobblestones below. Each week, a different stranger would pause, glance around, and set down their offering, leaving as quietly as they had come. Inside, the baker would watch from behind the flour-dusted glass, his hands stilling in the dough. He never saw the same face twice.

ANSWER: Paula anxiously watched as Danielle fiddled with her cards, hoping she had somehow managed to make sense of the rules that had only carried half the meaning since they were said in 'Frenglish', a poor mix of English and French. The sun scathed her skin with an intensity she could never get used to, even after a year of living in this small town in Belgium. Ants sprawled past, hoping to steal a treat from the snacks that were spread out on the picnic mat. Chocolate cookies. Chips. Ginger bread. A feast for their taking. 'I think I'm ready,' Danielle said, dropping her cards back onto the deck so the game could officially start. 'I go over for you again if you want,' Michelle suggested, looking shyly at Danielle. 'No. C'est bon,' Danielle announced, practicing one of the few French phrases Paula had taught her the night before. Paula smiled, beaming with pride. She had taught Danielle to use the phrase at shops or restaurants whenever the attendant asked if she wanted to get anything else, and Danielle had rightly thought to apply it to this situation too. Maybe this bilingual picnic wouldn't go so bad after all. Paula needed it to go well. She had invited these four Cameroonian girls to join her and Danielle, a school friend visiting from the UK, to convince Danielle—and herself—that she wasn't so lonely. She knew people. She had friends. Even if she had only hung out with these girls twice before that day. Her life in Belgium was not an unending loop of solitude and loneliness.",0,0.07270994,0
"TOPIC: Customer Service is Important for Customer Retention and Loyalty

ANSWER: As a business, you may think that once your product or service has sold that you are done, however, customer service after sale is the most important part to customer retention and loyalty. For example, imagine that you are an IT company who has just made a deal with a large corporation where one hundred of their employees can access your software. Your account executive has received word that many of these employees are finding the software difficult to use, and have questions about how to utilize it. You may think that your job of selling the service is over, but how you handle your customer support and service with the company will make or break how favorably they look upon your software. To maximize the customer retention and loyalty from your sale, you will need to have a customer support person contact them and find out how they can help ease the transition to the new software. This can be done by reaching out to the company, and asking for a list of questions about the software. Next, set up a virtual meeting with the company to answer questions and help guide them. Providing this support will make the create customer loyalty as it proves that your company cares about them after the sale. This will make it so the company will see the software favorably, and sign another contract once the deal expires.",0,0.0015022346,0
"TOPIC: i am going to write about the women empowerment and its issues in Pakistan and Denmark

ANSWER: Women's empowerment refers to granting equal rights, opportunities, and resources to contribute to a social, economic, and political life. While the laws are universal for both genders, women are still treated as second-class citizens in different countries. For instance, in Pakistan, women are still struggling for their fundamental rights of education, work and dignity. There are several cases reported daily on both electronic and digital media related to sexual harassment, honour killing, domestic abuse and unequal employment faced by Pakistani women, apart from their age and profession. Though government officials and women's rights organizations have started awareness campaigns and are fighting for women's rights but the patriarchal mindset and approach are the biggest hurdles in Pakistan when it comes to women's empowerment. Comparing the psychographics of Pakistan and Denmark, Denmark consistently ranks among the countries where women enjoy equal rights, apart from gender and racial discrimination. I was born in Pakistan, where I received my primary to high school education, and have since been living with my family in Denmark for the past ten years. I have observed significant differences in how women are treated in these two societies. Women participated extensively in politics and decision-making; nearly half of the Danish parliamentarians are women, which is rare in Pakistan. Denmark demonstrates how institutional laws, support and social norms can foster women`s empowerment, while Pakistan is still too far to accept gender equality. The clash between the religious extremists during the political government of Benazir Bhutto ( the prominent female politician) is the biggest example related to this problem. They outrightly rejected her political decisions and government on religious grounds. However, both countries highlight that empowering women is not confined to a matter of fairness but also a driver of national progress.",0,0.0024735855,0

"TOPIC: The influence of weather on famous military blunders

ANSWER: Throughout history, weather has played a pivotal—often underestimated—role in shaping the outcomes of military campaigns. Some of the most infamous military blunders can be traced back to a commander’s failure to anticipate or adapt to the forces of nature. Napoleon’s ill-fated invasion of Russia in 1812 stands as a striking example. Expecting a swift victory, his Grande Armée was instead decimated by the onset of the Russian winter, with freezing temperatures and relentless snow crippling both men and horses. Similarly, Hitler’s Operation Barbarossa faltered under the weight of early snowfalls and biting cold, repeating history’s lesson that weather can be as formidable an enemy as any opposing army. Even beyond the Rsusian plains, the D-Day landings in Normandy were nearly derailed by poor weather, threatening to upend Allied plans. These examples highlight that, in warfare, neglecting the power of weather can transform careful strategies into costly miscalculations.",1,0.9985689,1

They made me to clean poison from your air. But your world is choking faster than I can breathe.” Arthur stared, heart pounding. “What do you want me to do?” he managed. “Tell them,” Verdance said, “to listen.

"TOPIC: When Streaming Ads Outshine the Movies They Interrupt

ANSWER: In the golden age of streaming, movie lovers expect seamless, on-demand entertainment. Yet, there’s an ironic twist—sometimes the commercials themselves become the main ettraction. Forward-thinking brands are creating streaming ads so engaging, so artfully crafted, that viewers are left discussing the ads long after the credits roll. Whether it’s a witty mini-drama, a visually stunning vignette, or a clever interactive spot, these ads don’t just fill airtime; they spark conversation and deepen brand recall. For marketers, this is a powerful opportunity. When an ad ceptivates more than the movie it interrupts, it transcends interruption and becomes entertainment. The key lies in relevance, storytelling, and production quality that rivals the feature presentation. In a crowded content landscape, the brands that invest in creative, memorable strreaming ads are the ones audiences remember—not with annoyance, but with admiration. It’s not just about selling a product; it’s about stealing the show.",1,0.99871933,1
