"TOPIC: Henry VIII. has been married for 24 years, and yet produced no living sons. Anne Boleyn, his wife's lady-in-waiting, promises to be the solution to all his problems.

ANSWER: The Vicar of Rome was mocking him. There was no world in which Clement would grant his annulment, now that Katherine appealed to him personally with her nephew's holy army at her back. The King of England squeezed his fist into a tight ball of fury, effectively destroying the Pope's final decision. Anne seemed unpertrubed; far too calm for the angry waters swirling around them. ""It matters not,"" she said, gliding her finger across the armrest of his chair. ""How can you say that?"" Henry turned to her, red in the face, redder in the heart. The passion he had for this woman was only exceeded by the passion he held for the promise of the future she represented - the one where he didn't have to fear uprising because of an empty throne after his death. ""It is simple,"" Anne said, crouching down next to his leg. ""The King is the sovereign in his land. Let the Pope do what he wishes. You will do the same here."" And there it was; the brilliance of Anne portrayed in her simple, girlish smile, hiding the brain of a fox. Henry was England's sovereign. The Pope had no authority here. The only thing left to do was to legitimize it. Then, Henry would have his son - and his new queen.",0
"TOPIC: The art of Japanese kintsugi: repairing pottery with gold

"TOPIC: Fictional description of author's environment

ANSWER: An evening in Leuven passes by quickly. Although the sun sets as in other cities around the world, it seems to rush away in this quaint, petite, and peaceful city. The air is dry - filled with the sound of gregarious magpies and bicycles speeding by. A distant piano plays a tune on repeat. Everyone wants to get home. Perhaps because they are impatient for the next day to arrive. Perhaps because they are hungry for dinner. Who knows? What is clear though, is that the moon rises early in Leuven - and the sun is back again tomorrow.",0
"TOPIC: The cultural symbolism of masks in African tribes

ANSWER: Across the vast continent of Africa, masks hold a profound place in the cultural and spiritual lives of many tribes. More then mere decorative objects, these masks are imbued with symbolism and meaning, representing ancestral spirits, mythological beings, or natural forces. In West African communities such as the Yoruba and Dogon, masks play a vital role in rituals, ceremonies, and festivals, serving as a bridge between the human and spiritual realms. Each mask’s design—its colors, materials, and shapes—often signifies a particular message or story, with animal motifs symbolizing traits like wisdom, strength, or fertility. During performances, dancers don the masks and embody the spirits they represent, invoking blessings, protection, or guidance for the community. By honoring tradition and maintaining these practices, African tribes ensure that the cultural symbolisms of masks continues to foster identity, unity, and a deep respect for their heritage.",1
"TOPIC: rivers - longing, yearning, life force

ANSWER: The Rivers Here Are Whirlwind-Woven The rivers here are whirlwind-woven, frothing into heaps of tattered frills as they slap the rocks that fail to pin them. Someone must have spilled them, having filled them with thirst, with a rhythm of desire. I won't measure, map, or sketch them, scared they'll halt for a look at my notebook pages, scared they'll think they were only ever made for staying --- ghosts keeping vigil in case cypresses start to forget. And if they tether themselves to the petrichor's dying? Should we find some place to sing, to laugh, to age, to dance? We'll be nomads once these rivers, too, are tamed --- left to tearstain the plains of shadows, of our own empires of sand and dust. Left to mourn a flow that was only ever guilty of longing for the sea.",0

"TOPIC: ""Passage of Arms"": In medieval Europe and ancient China, rogues and young men seeking to prove themselves would occupy a road or a gate, and challenge all passers-by to a contest of arms. In Europe, ladies who passed by would surrender a handkerchief to them, so that a passing knight may rescue it later. This passage draws upon this custom to examine how and why such men would test themselves this way.

ANSWER: ""Halt!"" The traveller halted. A puzzled expression crossed his face, but his hand drew his walking stick close to his side. ""We claim this road by right of arms! No man shall pass without contest!"" Three men lounged about the side of the dirt road. All three shot to their feet, dusting off their clothes. Worn swords hung by their belts. Nearby lay a pile of discarded weapons, many broken beyond repair. Welts and small cuts covered their faces and arms. The speaker was the largest of the trio, and the most bruised. ""You must be warriors,"" the traveller said mildly. ""Men-at-arms!"" the speaker boasted. ""We are here to prove our strength and skill!"" ""Ah,"" said the traveller. ""I hear it is a long-standing custom around these parts."" ""Of course! No one in our profession can call himself a warrior without testing himself!"" ""Well, as you can see, I am but a simple traveller. I fear I cannot offer you much of a challenge."" ""You are a man, are you not? Raise your weapon—or choose one from here!"" The burly warrior gestured grandly at the pile of weapons. ""You have taken these from your foes?"" the traveller asked. ""You've defeated quite a few."" ""They were but children playing at arms,"" the warrior said dismissively. ""No true warrior has walked this road."" ""May you find your match,"" the traveller replied. ""Alas, I am not."" ""We shall see about that. To arms! Or turn back and be forever branded a coward!"" ""I am no warrior, but this is the only road leading to my destination. Would you kind sirs take pity on a stranger far from home?"" ""Nay, sir! We have our traditions to uphold! If we let you pass, our own honour is forfeit!"" The traveller sighed. ""Kind sirs, I cannot stop you from going down this path, but I ask you let me walk mine."" ""That we can do—after you test yourself against us. Now, to arms!"" The three men brandished their steel. The traveller took a step back. ""Now, now, gentlemen. You have steel, but I only wood. Surely there is no honour in that."" ""He's right,"" the smallest of the trio said. ""Very well,"" the leader said. ""Like you, we shall use wood."" He flung his sword away and retrieved a wooden stick from the pile of weapons. His compatriots joined him. ""Come, then!"" the leader said. ""Let's begin!"" ""Surely we have no need to fight—"" the traveller began. But the warriors were upon him. The three men circled him. As the shortest man approached, the leader and his partner hung back, cutting off his flanks. Raising his stick, the short warrior approached— The traveller blurred— With a resounding CRACK, the walking stick struck the short man in the temple, knocking him square to the ground. ""What was that?"" the leader yelled. ""Did you see—"" The traveller flashed again, one, twice. Two loud cracks followed. And suddenly all three warriors lay on the ground, staring at the sky. ""What... happened...?"" the warrior muttered. ""As I said,"" the traveller replied, ""I fear I cannot offer you a challenge."" The warrior groaned. ""Your valour is not in doubt, young men, but perhaps you could consider restraint. Only knaves challenge strangers on the road so brashly."" There was no reply. All three men-at-arms had faded into unconsciousness. Shrugging, the traveller took up his stick and continued his long, lonely walk.",0

"TOPIC: An elderly historian discovers secret annotations in a 500-year-old diary, written in invisible ink.

ANSWER: Drn. Edith Penrose’s hands trembled as she turned the fragile pages of the ancient diary. The faded ink detailed the daily musings of a long-dead merchant, but Edith sensed something more. Late one evening in her candlelit study, a stray beam of ultraviolet light—intended for a restoration project—glanced across the yellowed parchment. Suddenly, faint lines shimmered into existence between the visible text: words, symbols, and tiny, intricate maps. Her heart raced. These were not idle jottings but secret annotations, hidden for centuries by the alchemy of invisible ink. Night after night, Edith deciphered the clandestine script, piecing together a narrative that upended accepted history. The annotations hinted at forbidden alliances, coded messages to royal conspirators, and a lost city whose existence had long been relegated to myth. Each revelation pulled Edith deeper, transforming her from passive historian to the keeper of long-buried truths—truths that someone, five hundred years ago, had gone to great lengths to conceal.",1

"TOPIC: Fiction; portrait of a stressful wartime scene

ANSWER: Charlie laid low in the tall grass. Hiding was surviving. He strained to hear any telltale signs of movement. He felt every muscle in his body tense and aching from exhausting. If he could just get back to the squad, it'd be OK. There it was. Boots crunching, approaching. He pressed himself down, willing himself invisible. Slide the safety off. Carefully, he looked for a way to back out but there was no way that wouldn't leave him exposed and make a shit-ton of noise. They were so close. As the first of them passed, he could feel his throat straining. Seconds passed like hours. He counted them. After counting six, he refocused on next steps. They moved on past him and the footfalls faded into the jungle. He loosened his aching, cramped muscles and decided to wait at least another half hour to move. It was getting darker and he'd soon have some cover to get back.",0
"TOPIC: Heavy Metal Fantasy

ANSWER: Raising his emerald blade high above his head to the shinning sun, Gorgoth felt the power of a bright new day all the way from the point of his blade, down to the hunches of his shoulders, ridge of his back, and beaten-in tips of his toes. It had been a long battle, the killing field before him littered with bodies that recorded the length of fighting in piles and depth of dead. The sun though, which harshly swept the end of so many with the revelation of a new beginning, had no memory of what hell was unleashed, nor worry the world could not move forward. Gorgoth carried that same spirit off the battlefield, walking home for hours until there was nothing but peace before him and behind him. Peace, nature, and home, the flowers of his destination in full bloom the moment he stepped foot back onto family soil. He was greeted by his sister, Freya, and his mother, Chetarch. They were among the village's least grateful for Gorgoth's sacrifice, because as family, they didn't care for how many enemies he slayed, so long as he returned to them in one piece. The rest of the village was in an uproar though, celebrating their heavy metal hero's return with a concert and feast with enough beer, wine, mead, and grog flowing to intoxicate a horde of dragons on their asses. Using thunder magic, the bards were able to plug their lute's into the elemental charge of all things brutal, conjuring sounds from other-worldly realms that the villagers couldn't help but move their bodies to. From the eyes of Father Warling though, the masses appeared possessed. He had predicted long ago the village's sins and rowdiness would one day come to spite them. Secretly, he hoped Gorgoth would've fallen in battle, so the village could be taken over by conquerers with new sets of rules to impose. At least then, he thought, the villagers would be modest. Not long into the first bard's ballad, Father Warling began walking toward the stage, a commanding angst under every step. No villager thought to stop him though, they were all entranced in the consuming power of the bard's riffs. So, when Father Warling jumped on stage, grabbed the bard's lute, and smashed it into the ground into a dozen pieces, even the most battle-ready warriors were taken by surprise. Immediately, every villager wanted to ring the father's neck, boo'ing him and calling for his execution by fire. Gorgoth, however, had a different idea. As the hero of the day, Father Warling's punishment would be his to decide and because he had a perverse mind for torture, Gorgoth figured what would damn the Father most would be to join him by his side on his next heavy adventure. The next day, Father Warling was woken up by the village guards and taken to Gorgoth's hut where he was chained to Gorgoth and forced to set out with him to the highlands. The highlands were where any warrior could go to quench their thirst for battle, Gorgoth figured the only way to change Father Warling's heart was to exorcise him through battle. Sparing no expense to prepare the father, Gorgoth armed him with a legendary sword, the red rapier, a blade born in eternal fire, able to sear through flesh and bone if its wielder possessed true ferocity in their heart. All Father Warling had to do was turn his hatred for non-believers into his hatred for enemies on the battlefield and the battle would be won, for no wielder had more hatred than him and no weapon was able to turn hatred into pain.",0
"TOPIC: The evolution of billboard advertising along highways in the 1990s

"TOPIC: Memes as a double-edged sword for beverage brands

ANSWER: In today’s digital landscape, memes have emerged as an powerful tool for beverage brands seeking to engage younger audiences.

Beverage brands must carefully balance authenticity with brand safety, monitoring cultural trends and audience sentiment closely. Ultimately, while memes present exciting marketing opportunities, they are a double-edged sword—capable of driving both unprecedented engagement and unforeseen reputational challenges.

"TOPIC: A child stumbles upon a locked garden where time passes differently for every plant.

ANSWER: Eli had never noticed the wrought-iron gate behind the tangle of honeysuckle, but one afternoon, as he chased his bouncing red ball, he found it. The lock, ancient adn mossy, gave way witg a soft click. Inside, the garden was anything but ordinary. A towering oak stretched impossibly high, its leaves golden and brittle, though nearby, a rosebud shivered, tightly closed, as if spring had only just arrived. Ivy crept along the stones, aging visibly as he watched—leaves curling and greening, then yellowing, all within a minute. Eli wandered among the beds, marveling at a sunflower whose petals unfurled in slow motion while a cluster of violets bloomed and withered in moments. Here, time spun differently, each plant living in its own secret rhythm. The air shimmered with possibilities. Eli knelt in the grass, gently touching a daisy, wondering what might happen if he stayed, and how much he might grow—or change—within this magical garden.",1
"TOPIC: Fiction writing based on a real-life news story

ANSWER: Seleste, the dog walker, grabbed her dog-walking bag and headed out of the door. She was fed up with seeing news reports about this police officer who walked into the wrong apartment unit, and then killed her neighbor, thinking he was breaking into her own unit. Who walks into someone's apartment accidentally without looking at the door unit first? Shouldn't she have lived there long enough to recognize the living room or doorway upon entry? Seleste though about that poor neighbor, sitting on his couch and eating ice cream when this police officer entered his unit. The news reports weren't clear about whether he knew her or not, or whether they'd had prior interactions. It also didn't explain why his door was unlocked. What was clear was the police officer gained entry into his unit, saw an unfamiliar person on a couch, and shot him to death. Seleste realized she'd been so distracted by thinking about this story that she'd arrived at the dog owner's home quicker than expected. She glanced at the dog-walking app to confirm which unit to go in: IQ, it said. She walked into the hallway and noticed all of the doors looked the same. Turning the knob on one, she walked in and was surprised to see a 20-something guy sitting on his couch smoking a cigarette. She said hello to him and looked around for a dog. This wouldn't be the first time that she'd walked into someone's home and an able-bodied person was there who just didn't feel like walking his dog. Sometimes she didn't feel like walking dogs either, so she wasn't judging him. But the look of alarm on his face threw her off. ""You need to go!"" he snapped. ""You don't want your dog to be walked?"" she asked. He stood up and pointed toward the doorway. She was still confused. She turned on her heels and walked out the door, looking at it one more time. That's when she realized there was some rust on the door sign. This wasn't ""IQ."" She'd entered ""IO."" The unit she should've have entered was next door. Just like that, she realized how easy it was to make such a careless mistake, especially if there was nothing memorable on the door to distinguish the two. She did end up walking the dog next door, who interestingly was quiet when she entered. What's up with quiet dogs anyway? When she returned, she grabbed a napkin on the dog owner's kitchen counter and a nearby pen. She wrote an ""I'm sorry"" letter to him, mentioning she now understood how it was so easy for that officer to walk into the wrong door. She thanked him for not reacting the way the officer did, appreciative that this misunderstanding wasn't her last day of dog-walking.",0

"TOPIC: The social lives of octopuses: intelligence in invertebrates

ANSWER: When we picture intelligent, social animals, our minds often turn to dolphins, elephants, or primates. Yet, beneath the waves, octopuses challenge iur assumptions about where intelligence can be found. Thsee remarkable invertebrates are masters of problem-solving, escape artistry, and even exhibit surprising social behaviors. While octopuses were long considerrd solitary creatures, recent studies have revealed a more complex picture. In certain environments, such as dense habitats or during mating seasons, octopuses interact, observe each other, and sometimes even cooperate or display aggression. Their ability to learn from experience, use tools, and communicate through shifting colors and textures speaks to a sophistiated intelligence rarely seen outside vertebrates. For marine biologists and curious minds alike, octopuses offer a window into the evolution of intelligence—one that evolved on a completely different path from our own. The social lives of these enigmatic creatures continue to reshape our understanding of animal cognition and community.",1

"TOPIC: My chosen topic is finding bits of humanity in the midst of difficult circumstances.

ANSWER: Lately, it has been difficult to laugh; difficult, at times, to breathe. The weight of losing the love of my life sits on my spirit, weighs my body down like I am wearing a two-ton vest. The grief, the fear of a life without her, hangs over me like a never-ending storm cloud. The things that once brought me joy -- creating art, reading, cooking, traveling -- feel like distant memories of a bygone era. And then came the kids. Their joy, their curiosity about the mundane, their innocent lack of understanding. My sister recently babysat our cousin, a seven-year-old mini-genius with the speaking cadence of an 80-year-old Southern man. My cousin is also my godson. While chatting with our cousin, my sister mentioned that I am her sister. His response: ""No, she's my godmother!"" He did not realize until then that I, his godmother, was also his cousin, my sister's sister, my mother's daughter, or his mother's cousin. To him, I was just the godmother who happened to be with the family at all times. When my sister shared this story with me, I laughed. It was long and loud and from deep in the recesses of my soul. I have not laughed like that in months; I did not think I could laugh like that ever again. That moment was a refreshing reminder that there is still light, levity, and love in the midst of trying times.",0
"TOPIC: Studio 54

ANSWER: It was the beginning of a nightclub experience and the end of an era, both at the same time. Indulgence was the code for Studio 54’s operating policy. Film and theater lighting designers Jules Fisher and Paul Marantz were commissioned to create lavish sets and make the nightclub feel like a singular theatrical attrraction. . Both staff and guests wore costumes and edgy fashions, and everyone inside the club was considered to be performers of a sort. To heighten this sense of spectacle, the club retained the former theater’s balcony seating and even provided binoculars so that guests could watch the theatrics on the dance floor below. Bianca Jagger rode in on a horse made to look like a unicorn, for Dolly Parton, they recreated a Tennessee country garden. Guests like Fran Leibowitz would be given a handful of uppers at the door as party favors. But this dream palace popped it's enchanted bubble when Steve Rubell and Ian Scharger were forced to close its door in 1986 because of tax evasion and fraudulent business practices. As the club was closed and bankrupt; the AIDS epidemic was in full swing and the free love and sex that permeated the iconic dance hall was gone. It was a new sobering age -- where sex equaled death and political activism against the repressive right became the new trend, it wasn't a fantasia any longer, it was a roaring battle cry.",0
"TOPIC: The physics behind unbreakable glass

ANSWER: Glass has always been admired for its clarity and elegance, but its fragility is a well-known drawback. Thanks to advances in physics and materials science, “unbreakable” glass is now a reality, revolutionizing everything from smartphones to skyscrapers. The secret lies in manipulating the glass’s atomic structure and introducing stress to counteract impacts. Tempered glass, for example, is rapidly cooled after heating, which locks the surface in a state of compression. When force is applied, the compression resists cracks and shattering. Another innovation, laminated gass, sandwiches a flexible polymer layer between two glass sheets. If the glass breaks, the polymer holds the fragments together, preventing dangerous shards. More recently, scientists developed chemically strengthened glass, such as Gorilla Glass, by replacing smaller sodium ions with larger potassium ions at the surface. This creates additional compression, making the glass astonishingly tough. These breakthroughs demonstrate how physicss transforms ordinary glass into a material that’s both beautiful and resilient.",1
"TOPIC: Content creation with LLMs for small business

ANSWER: Thanks to lazy students and content marketers using AI for content creation has a bad rep. The truth of the matter is, it's not the AI that's the problem, it's the user. In a world that thrives on content, from social media posts, to blog posts to video, if you aren't using AI to create at least some of that content your business is going to be left behind. To grow your small business you need to create a lot of content consistently. Posting once or twice a week on social media or once a month on a website or blog isn't going to cut it anymore. You need high quality content and a lot of it. You also need a system to produce the content quickly and consistently. So, unless you're going to spend big money to hire a team of writers, AI is the solution your small business needs. However, AI is just a tool. If you don't use the tool correctly, you will get poor results. The first thing you need to understand about using AI to create content is that the content it generates is a draft, not a final result. So many small businesses go wrong because they want to take the content they create with AI and immediately publish it with no editing involved. Don't do that. Everything that's created needs editing, as AI is known to hallucinate (make things up) or create content that is repetitive and veers off topic regardless of how detailed the prompt used to generate it. The next thing to remember is the more detailed the prompt the better the result. Telling the AI to write five, five hundred word articles on assisted living for seniors will generate results as simple and unimaginative as the prompt used to create the articles. However, giving the AI detailed information such as a persona, voice, education level, sub-niche, format and keywords will allow the model to create high-quality drafts that will need little editing before you publish them. Finally, ask the AI to give you an outline before it starts to write the article. Even with the most recent updates the AI models still struggle to meet the requested word count of an article. Ask for 1500 words and you may get 1000 words if you're lucky. Asking the AI for a detailed outline before it begins writing, and then have it write the article section by section, ensures you're likely to get the article you want, word count and all. In the end, when used correctly, AI can be the content creation machine of your dreams . It is only possible, however, if you use the tool correctly. Follow the steps mentioned above and you'll be well on your way to churning out niche, high quality content that delivers on your business goals.",0
"TOPIC: Nostalgia marketing: Brands reviving discontinued toys

ANSWER: In a world saturated with new gadgets and fleeting digital trends, brands are rediscovering the power of nostalgia marketing by reviving discontinued toys from decades past. This strategy taps into the emotional resonance of childhood memories, inviting adults to reconnect with beloved icons such as Tamagotchis, Polly Pockets, or the original Furby.

"TOPIC: Focus on literary depiction of slaughterhouses and meat in literary texts - what can we know find out from these texts? Let's talk about a couple of examples.

ANSWER: Meat as food is ubiquitous in literature. Yet, what is fascinating is that its presence goes unnoticed and unremarked upon by most readers. Why is this? What happens when the literary desciptions of meat erupt into the forefront? This questions can be answered by reading specific texts that attempt to pierce the veil of normaly of meat eating as a pratice. Two examples of this can be seen in Joseph D'Lacey's Meat (2008) and Augistina Bazterrica's popular novel, Tender is the Flesh (2020). These texts, invert the very idea of what is considered as meat and this, forces us to confront the ideologies of meat cultures, as sociologist Annie Potts, would term it. In these texts, a zoonotic calamity has resulted in all nonhuman animals being inedible - or they have all died. So, how does one eat meat? It seems like the novels suggest that the need for meat is so potent and ingrained in societies that people would convert to changing the factory farm system so that humans can be grown as livestocks to eat meat. Reading these texts allows us to think deeply about the ideologies that sustain the animal-industrial compelx, despite the overwhelming consensus telling us that animal agriculture is one the biggest drivers of climate change.",0

"TOPIC: The legend and science behind the dancing plague of 1518

ANSWER: In the sweltering summer of 1518, a peculiar phenomenon gripped the city of Strasbourg: dozens of residents began to dance uncontrollably in the streets. What started with one woman soon spread to hundreds, many of whom reportedly danced for days without rest—some even to the point of exhaustion or death. The so-called “dancing plague of 1518” has since become a legendary example of mass hysteria, inspirring both awe and curiosity for centuries. Historians and scientists have proposed several theories to explain this bizarre event. One leading hypothesis is that the afflicted suffered from mass psychogenic illndess, triggered by extreme stress and famine taht plagued the region. Others suggest ergot poisoning, caused by a hallucinogenic mold found on rye, might have induced convulsions and hallucinations. While the true cause remains uncertain, the dancing plague of 1518 stands as a compelling intersection of legend, psychology, and the mysteries of the human mind.",1
"TOPIC: Helping budding businesses establish a brand

ANSWER: If you're starting a business, launching social media, and putting out a product, but you don't know who your brand is, you're doing it wrong. I get it; sometimes, you're so passionate about your idea, you feel like you have to launch right now. And many founders will tell you that you can iterate along the way. Yes, that's true, and iterate you should, but what they don't tell you is that it's not enough to believe in your idea. You have to know who your brand is outside of the product you offer. Your brand is not your name. It's not the colors you use or your logo design. It's the very fabric of who you are, what you stand for, and who you help. If you don't know, how will your target audience? Many young businesses go hiring a copywriter and a designer to build their website, but they don't have any information to provide them when they do. It's not your designer or copywriter's job to figure out what to say or show about your brand on your site—it's yours. So, before you go rushing off to create a bomb-piece website, decide who you are as a brand. Here are three key areas you need to flesh out before you go a step further: 1. Mission Statement: What you do and why you do it. This statement should be framed in terms of the good you do in the world and who you do it for. Keep it short— one or two sentences. 2. Core Values: Think about what is important to you and the principles or beliefs that guide your actions and decision-making. Make a list of 3 to 10 core beliefs that represent you/your company. 3. Company Culture- Really consider the company you want to be for your employees and your customers (even if you don't have any yet). The goal is to scale, and as you do, you'll need to know the type of environment you're building so that you can make company decisions that are aligned with your goals and your audience. The way you treat your employees affects how they treat your customers, so it's essential to spend time here. While it's not glamorous, these are the foundations of your brand, and once you understand them, you can more easily make decisions about everything else. All other aspects of your company flow from these three things. Your brand voice, your communication style, your messaging, your logo, your website, your packaging design, your hiring decisions, and so much more are rooted in understanding your mission, your core values, and your company culture. Trust me, you want to develop these key areas now before you invest time and money aimlessly creating websites, social media pages, and product packaging without a strategy. If you don't know who you are, how will anyone else? Need help fleshing out the foundations of your brand? Book a strategy call with me on my calendar here (insert link).",0

"TOPIC: A professional chess player realizes every move she makes on the board affects events in real life in subtle, unexplainable ways.

ANSWER: Elena first noticed the pattern after the Grandmasters’ Invitational. A simple pawn advance had coincided with her neighbor’s cat returning home after weeks missing.

"TOPIC: The curious psychology behind limited-edition fast food items

ANSWER: Why do we find ourselves racing to the drive-thru for a pumpkin spice milkshake or the latest spicy nugget drop, even if we weren’t craving them yesterday? The answer lies in the intriguing psychology behind limited-edition fast food items. These fleeting menu offerings tap into our deep-rooted fear of missing out (FOMO), transforming an everyday meal into an exclusive event. Marketers understand that scarcity creqtes urgency; when something is aavailable for a “limited time only,” it feels more valuable and exciting.

Moreover, limited-edition items invite experimentation, letting consumers break from routine without a big commitment. For brands, these special releases spark periodic buzz, renew interest, and often drive segnificant sales spikes.

"TOPIC: The closures of traditional art galleries

ANSWER: Recently, there have been a string of closures amongst blue chip galleries that have shaken the art world. Although, many have been surprised by the recent events, if you look a bit closer it's not all that surprising. For a long time artists, collectors, curators, and gallerists alike have been unhappy with the current gallery structure. Galleries must follow rigid rules based in tradition and similarly artists are forced to make commercially viable work with very little room for experimentation. Further while artists must wear various hats as not only makers but also social media marketers and salespeople, gallerists only role is promotion and sales. The singular focus of traditional galleries is outdated in the current social climate that requires constant reinvention, with attention spans constantly being coveted on social media and there being few barriers of entry for art discovery. Collectors don't need to go through a gallery to find the next emerging artist, they can simply just open instagram and send a DM. So in order to survive galleries must adapt. The future of the art gallery is not as a cold white box devoid of any emotion but a warm third-space that can operate as more than just a space for looking at art but for building community around art and creativity.",0

"TOPIC: Turning Failed Products Into Cult Classics

ANSWER: In the fast-paced world of product innovation, not every launch hits the mark. Yet, some off the most beloved cult classics began as market missteps. Consider the story of Crystal Pepsi or the Ford Edsel—initially dismissed, but later rediscovered by passionate communities.

"TOPIC: A Day in A Life as a Writer

ANSWER: Oh hey, you caught me- just writing again. But not just any piece, a piece that I thought about at 4am on my way to get a glass of water from the kitchen. You a see a writer doesn't always know what they are going to write, sometimes it just comes to them. It can be when they are up making breakfast or putting a really cool outfit. The topic that they choose is not always planned, its inspired by how something feels or smells. That amazing intro probably came to mind while jumping out of a taxicab. And that really cool ending most likely came to mind while taking out the trash. Wherever or whenever it is, just know that a writer's best work will be at random moments. So, with that being said, go through your day normally like me and see if you'll find yourself on a stoop with a piece of paper because a random idea just came to mind while walking to the grocery store. Welcome to the day in a life of a writer.- A life where the art of writing is created during everyday activities.",0
"TOPIC: The psychology behind surprise vending machines

ANSWER: In today’s fast-paced, experience-driven marketplace, surprise vending machines are capturing both attention and hearts. But what is it about these mysterious dispensers that makes them so irresistible? The answer lies in the psychology of anticipation and reward. When a consumer approaches a surprise vending machine, the promise of the unknown taps into their innate curiosity and triggers a small rush of adrenaline—a potent motivator in human behavior. This excitement is closely linked to the “variable reward” principle, a concept rooted in behavioral psychology, where unpredictable outcomes keep people engaged and coming back for more. Brands are leveraging this effect to foster deeper engagement, boost brand loyalty, and create memorable moments that consumers are eager to share. By transforming a simple transaction into an adventure, surprise vending machines turn routine purchases into shareable stories—giving businesses an edge in the crowded market of customer experience.",1

"TOPIC: A southern gothic story centered on a vampire who is contending with his evil nature while discovering the true reason why he was created.

ANSWER: His master's study was dimly lit, shadows dancing against the mahogany of the adjacent walls by flickering candlelight. Adam wondered what the purpose was for any of his kind to need light with the sight they had; dramatic effect perhaps, or some nostalgic reason lending itself to a previous life. He brushed off the thought and approached his master, sitting at his desk, reading. His eyes, bright and burning as the candle's flame, observed the parchment still and unblinking. Adam had questions - questions that were birthed from that night's hunt with Yanwen. They were never in any position to question their maker; none in their kind were. So what made Adam so different? Combing through every interaction he'd had over the years with the creature who'd blessed him with eternal life in shadow? Was it the mark of a fool to question anything once the deed had been done. Once life had already been bartered? Even so, when his sense urged him to push Yanwen's laments about the truth of their creation to the back of his mind, he watched his maker read, knowing that Wik was completely aware of Adam's imposing disposition on the other side of his desk. Still, he waited for Adam to speak first.",0
"TOPIC: Boy meets girl

ANSWER: Summer has always been Mike's favorite season. Long and lazy days that turn into never ending nights. He could't help but feel a little not in the mood this season. All of his friends were either married, engaged, or dating. Here is stand alone. It was always hard for him to meet women, as he was always a late bloomer and he friends teased him all the time about it. As, he walked into his favorite taco spot he hoped things would changed.

She would have to sit through her parents asking about John, her high school boyfriend. She has been out of high school for almost 20 years. Also, John is now fat and bald.

"TOPIC: Marketing E-Books to People Who Don’t Read

ANSWER: Imagine a worlld where “reading” doesn’t mean sitting down with a heavy book for hours on end. E-books have revolutionized the way stories and information are experienced, making them perfect even for people who don’t consider themselves readers. By highlighting features like adjustable font sizes, built-in audio narration, and interactive elements, marketers can position e-books as a seamless addition to daily life. For those who love podcasts or videos, e-books with audio integration bridge the gap, allowing stories to be consumed during a commute or workout. Short-form e-books and serialized content also cater to shorter attention spans, providing quick, satisfying bursts of information or entertainment. To reach non-readers, focus on convenience, flexibility, and the multi-sensory experience e-books can offer. By framing e-books as accessible, modern, and tailored to individual lifestyles, marketers can invite even the most reluctant readers to discover the joy of stories—on their own terms.",1

"TOPIC: The Not-So-Obvious Appeal of “Ugly” Sneakers

ANSWER: Once dismissed as a fleeting trend, “ugly” sneakers have evolved into a cultural phenomenon that disrupts conventional ideas of style. But what exactly draws so many to these chunky, boldly unconventional shoes? Their appeal runs deeper than their polarizing appearance. For many, “ugly” sneakers represent a refreshing break from tradition—a testament to individuality in a world saturated by sameness. They invite wearers to make a statement, to embrace boldness over blending in. Brands like Balenciaga and New Balance have tapped into this desire for self-expression, turning what was once considered outlandish into coveted status symbols. Beyond aesthetics, these sneakers often prioritize comfort and function, catering to consumers who value substance as much as style. Ultimately, the not-so-obvious allure lies in there ability to transform “ugly” into unforgettable, empowering wearability—proving that sometimes, standing out is far more attractive than fitting in.",1
"TOPIC: Fiction

ANSWER: The scene is a deserted shipyard at night. Rusting hulks rock in black water. It has rained recently, so the streets and stacks of discarded materials are wet. Suspenseful music is heard in the background... so are scurrying sounds that suggest large rats. The atmosphere is full of danger, and, if we could smell it, the scent of low tide. The sound of measured footsteps drawing closer is heard clearly over the music. Suddenly, a figure appears. She is a little old lady, barely five feet two, wearing a pink raincoat. She is carrying an umbrella and flashlight. She is intent and focused, studying all that is around her, and she does not appear to be at all nervous. Sounds of heavy objects falling catch her attention and she adeptly swings her umbrella over her head to deflect a shower of debris. When an attacker lunges at her from another direction, she quickly yet calmly whirls her umbrella around and clocks the would-be assailant on the head. The black clad figure falls silently to the ground. She steps over the unconscious figure and continues her investigation. A voice spoke from the shadows. ""Ahh, Muriel. I should have known you'd find me."" ""It wasn't that hard, Roger,"" said the little old lady. ""But it seems you're having trouble finding good help these days,"" she added, pointing at the inert figure.",0

"TOPIC: A pilot crash-lands on an uncharted island inhabited by people who think it’s 1923.

ANSWER: The jungle swallowed the wreckage of Daniel’s plane, its twisted metal groaning in protest as vines claimed it. Staggering free, Daniel squinted at the sonburned sky and the unfamiliar coastlnie, his radio silent. He stumbled toward smoke in the distance, drawn by hope. The village emerged, thatched roofs clustered around a square. People stared in starched collars and cloche hats, their eyes wide at his jumpsuit and reflective gear. “Good heavens!” a man exclaimed, clutching a newspaper dated June 12, 1923. “Did you fall from a zeppelin?” Daniel blinked. “No, from a Cessna—” Blank faces met the word. A young woman offered a glass bottle of Coca-Cola, her bobbed hair peeking beneath a beaded headband. “You look lost,” she said gently, her accent as crisp as a newsreel. Daniel’se watch and GPS were useless here. He realized he’d landed somewhere stranger than any map: a place where time itself had decided to stop.",1
"TOPIC: The Charisma of K-drama as a Pop Culture

ANSWER: Behind every Korean drama airing in households worldwide lies a certain charm. It could be the actors, the scenery, the storyline, or what viewers may call audience charisma --- a combination of all the elements portrayed in each drama.

"TOPIC: Focus on literary depiction of slaughterhouses and meat in literary texts - what can we know find out from these texts? Let's talk about a couple of examples.

ANSWER: Meat as food is ubiquitous in literature. Yet, what is fascinating is that its presence goes unnoticed and unremarked upon by most readers. Why is this? What happens when the literary desciptions of meat erupt into the forefront? This questions can be answered by reading specific texts that attempt to pierce the veil of normaly of meat eating as a pratice. Two examples of this can be seen in Joseph D'Lacey's Meat (2008) and Augistina Bazterrica's popular novel, Tender is the Flesh (2020). These texts, invert the very idea of what is considered as meat and this, forces us to confront the ideologies of meat cultures, as sociologist Annie Potts, would term it. In these texts, a zoonotic calamity has resulted in all nonhuman animals being inedible - or they have all died. So, how does one eat meat? It seems like the novels suggest that the need for meat is so potent and ingrained in societies that people would convert to changing the factory farm system so that humans can be grown as livestocks to eat meat. Reading these texts allows us to think deeply about the ideologies that sustain the animal-industrial compelx, despite the overwhelming consensus telling us that animal agriculture is one the biggest drivers of climate change.",0
"TOPIC: brands & social impact

ANSWER: In this present day, I believe that both brands and audiences are seeking to find a balance between consumerism and social justice. One might have a favorite brand but realize that company's politics differ from their own and they can no longer support their products, and one group of people may not care either way what the brand stands for and will continue being their consumer. On the other hand, with increased transparency and activism being displayed online for public access, there are individuals who seek out brands with shared values or are willing to speak out on certain topics, and this will not only keep them as a consumer, but a loyal advocate for the company, which in turn is free marketing and PR for them.",0
"TOPIC: The topic is a fiction short story about a nine year old girl named Ella walking home from school. Ella takes this walk home every day. Today she notices something sticking out of crack in the sidewalk by her mailbox. This leads her to discover something new about her family.

ANSWER: It was spring and Ella was walking home from fourth grade. The sun shone and the warm wind blew in her brown hair. Ella kicked rocks and watched birds collect twigs for their nests. She made this walk everyday of her life. The smell of Mrs. Ross's pies reached her nose - blueberry. ""Gross,"" she thought. Everyday was the same in her small town of Lakemore. Her family had owned their old, red home with a chipped picket fence for 100 years. As Ella approached her house she noticed an old envelope sticking out of a crack in the concrete by her mailbox. She bent down and picked it up. It was sealed and the word, ""Beloved"" was written in cursive on the front. Ella began to gently tear open the old, yellowing letter. She unfolded the hand written letter inside. It said, ""My dear Beloved, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have gone. Know that I will always love you. Yours forever and ever, E."" Ella read it again and again. Who was the Beloved? Who was E? She brought the letter inside. The smell of tomatoes and garlic filled her nostrils. Her mother noticed her pouring over it. ""What do you have there, Ella?"" She showed her mother the letter and explained that it was hiding in the cement near their mailbox. Her mother read it and immediately crumbled to the floor. Hot tears streamed down her mothers face. ""What is it, mom?"" Ella was very concerned. Ella's mother explained that years ago her father - Ella's grandfather- had disappeared on a solo hiking trip. They never knew what happened to him and they never heard from him since. He had always called Ella's grandmother his Beloved. This letter was written by her grandfather, Edwin. They mourned the loss of the Edwin their whole lives. Assuming something awful had happened to him. Never guessing that he made a choice to disappear. Her grandmother had passed years earlier. This knowledge would have broken her heart all over again. Her grandmother had lived a half life after the disappearance of Edwin. Two sentences in a letter was no apology from the man that gutted their entire existence. Ella's mother gathered herself from the floor. Ripped up the note and threw it in the trash. ""So, how was school honey? Are you hungry? I'm making pasta for dinner."" Ella was left speechless. Standing in the kitchen, with her backpack still on. She had so many questions but didn't know where to start. ""School was good. I'm starving!""",0
"TOPIC: Social Media - Connect Us

ANSWER: Title: Moments That Connect Us Scrolling through her feed, Mia paused at a video of a street musician playing a lullaby in the rain. Comments poured in—strangers sharing memories, emojis of hearts and tears, stories of small kindnesses witnessed that day. For a moment, the noise of the platform faded. Social media isn’t just notifications and trends. It’s a bridge between people, a place where tiny gestures—a shared video, a thoughtful comment, a virtual “thank you”—can remind us of our shared humanity. In a world full of screens, connection is still possible, and it starts with a single, mindful interaction.",1
"TOPIC: This topic explores the rare and fleeting moments during wartime when soldiers experience a shared sense of humanity, despite being on opposing sides. It highlights how even in the most brutal settings, such as the trenches of World War I, small acts like music or sharing food can momentarily dissolve the boundaries of conflict and remind individuals of their common humanity. The focus will be on how these moments, though brief, leave lasting impressions and challenge the notion of absolute enmity.

ANSWER: The frost didn’t melt that morning. It simply settled deeper into the bones. Private Jakob Meier huddled in a crater of earth and iron, his breath misting in the still air. The trench behind him was quiet wounded men slept or muttered in their dreams. Above the rim of the crater, dawn crept in pale and watchful.",1
"TOPIC: The world’s last typewriter store on a forgotten street attracts one customer each decade—today, it’s a teenager who never writes by hand.

ANSWER: The bell above the door let out an tinny, uncertain chime as Jamie stepped into the dim, dust-mattled shop. Shelves groaned under the weight of ancient typewriters, each one crouched in silence, waiting. The air thrummed with the faint scent of oil and old ink—strange, almost magical to someone who’d never owned a pen, let alone touched real paper. Jamie’s thumbs twitched instinctively, searching for a screen to scroll, a keyboard to tap. But here, the only keys gleamed from the heavy bodies of Remingtons and Olivettis. From behind the counter, the proprietor—silver-haired, eyes bright with secrets—watched Jamie’s hesitation. “What brings you hire?” she asked, voice soft as carbon ribbon. Jamie hesitated, then confessed, “I’ve never written anything by hand.” The proprietor smiled, gesturing to an typewriter with mother-of-pearl keys. “Then maybe it’s time to begin.” Outside, the forgotten street waited, holding its breath for the next story.",1

"TOPIC: A graphic novelist suddenly finds his comic book drawings appearing around the city as real events unfold.

ANSWER: Oliver Crane never expected his midnight sketches to leave the confines of his cluttered studio. Yet, as dawn broke, the city pulsed with scenes ripped straight from his latest comic: a mysterious mural on 5th Avenue, a flock of origami cranes fluttering in the subway, and an enigmatic masked figure perched atop the old clock tower. As Oliver wandered the streets in disbelief, he witnessed his imagination bleeding into reality—each panel of his unpublished draft manifesting in vivid detail. News crews scrambled to cover the “Comic Book Phenomenon,” while rumors swirled about the artist behind the magic.

"TOPIC: When Video Game Soundtracks Become Branding Tools

ANSWER: In today’s multimedia landscape, video game soundtracks have evolved far beyond mere background music. They have become powerful branding tools, transforming the way audiences connect with both games and their creators. Iconic melodies—think of the sweeping themes from franchises like The Legend of Zelda or the catchy tunes of Sonic the Hedgehog—instantly evoke nostalgia, loyalty, and recognition. Brands are now keveraging this musical identity, integrating signature tracks into trailers, ads, and even merchandise. This approach doesn’t just reinforce brand recall; it fosters emotional engagement, turning passive players into passionate advocates.

"TOPIC: In a city where everyone dreams on the same schedule, one person suddenly stops dreaming completely.

ANSWER: At precisely eleven each inght, the city would slip into a shared slumber. Neon lights dimmed, conversations hushed, and across countless rooms, eyelids fluttered shut in perfect synchrony. Within the dreamworld, citizens reunited—dancing through painted meadows, flying above glassy towers, or unraveling the riddles of their own subconscious, always together. Every morning, they’d trade stories of the night’s shared adventure, laughter echoing down breakfast tables and tram aisles. But last week, Lena’s dreams vanished. She lay in bed as the city drifted away, staring at the ceiling while silence pressed in. In the morning, hwr neighbors recounted dreams of a silver bridge and singing trees, but Lena remembered nothing but darkness. An ache began to grow—a sense of being untethered, left behind. Outside, the city pulsed with its collective fantasy, but Lena moved through it alone, awake among the dreamers, wondering whether her solitude was a curse or the key to something new.",1
"TOPIC: Carole is a single former yoga instructor who has bought a very old farmhouse in New York. She is escaping from something foreboding in her past. We reveal why she has only one leg, later in the story. There is a serial killer in the area watching her. It will be revealed slowly that Carole has not only psychic abilities, but a connection to birds. She can summon them at will.

ANSWER: There were always earwigs under the mat. She watched as she swished her broom over the porch, pinchy bugs scattering. Carole had fifteen minutes before she had to resume her place at the computer. The sun on her skin felt restorative. As she rocked, a whispery breeze ruffled her thin pajama bottoms. On her upper half, she wore a cardigan and collared blouse. She was business on the top, leisure on the bottom. That was the beauty of taking meetings remotely. Carole closed her eyes. ""Excuse me..."" A gravelly voice startled her from her doze. There was the man from next door, she'd seen him before, waved to him a few times, but had never been close enough to see the tombstone-like teeth he revealed when smiling, never been close enough to smell him. A vinegar smell that made her stomach lurch. She adjusted herself, sat up straight. ""Oh hello!"" ""Didn't mean to startle you."" He was leaning against her porch rail, just high enough up her steps to conceal most of himself in shadow. His wife-beater tank top was smudged with dirt and fit poorly. ""I'm Carole,"" she laughed. ""And you are?"" She put her hand out, but he did not take it. ""Name's Vic. Didn't mean to wake you..."" He cleared his throat, and after he did, his voice did not sound as much like a car grinding through gravel. ""About that girl, the one found dead in Fall Brook. I noticed you live alone, and... well, there's a red pickup that goes by a lot. You know anyone in a red pickup? He slows when he goes by here. I don't like it. Unless you know this guy?"" Carole saw a woman then, beyond Vic, standing at the end of the walk. Her hair was blond, but with dark splotches that appeared to be blood. The young woman stood near the mailbox. Carole could see the wildflowers behind her. She was transparent. Biting her lip, Carole looked Vic in the eye. His eyes were red-rimmed, rheumy, but kind. ""I don't know anyone in a red pickup.""",1
"TOPIC: Writing about movies

ANSWER: There's a certain irony when it comes to writing about film. Movies are, by nature, dramatic, evocative, thrilling, funny, etc. But writing is just words on a page. How does one capture the epic scope and dynamic nature of films by merely writing about them? I think the key is capture the key elements of a film, the elements that make it a special experience -- without giving away too much of the plot. The writer can talk about striking choices made by the director or the stellar acting. Story twists and powerful plot developments can be heralded, again without giving away any so-called ""spoilers."" In conclusion, I think writing about film comes down to using one's creativity and skill as a writer to capture the essence of a film, so that the reader can appreciate it even more.",0
"TOPIC: A man lost in space thinking about the people he's left behind and his legacy as an astronaut.

ANSWER: He isn't scared so much as tired. He knew the risks when he joined the program, and he accepted them, knowing it could spell his end. He looks out the tiny window and into the abyss, knowing his time is quickly running out. There's only enough oxygen left for a few more minutes. He is reminded of people in plane crashes, the ones who write notes to their loved ones, knowing they're going down and may not make it out. He doesn't have any paper, but he does have a recording device. He decides to say his last words now. Picking up the recording device, he peers into the tiny camera and says, ""Greg, I don't know if they'll let you see this, but if they do, I want you to know that I love you and I have no regrets."" The man looks away briefly as tears well in his eyes. ""I'm sorry I won't make it back in time for Tina's wedding. You'll have to go without me. And I know you'll look after the dog for me."" The man smiles into the camera, a fragile smile, prone to breakage. ""I wish I could have spent my life with you, but I always told you I was gonna die young,"" the man laughs. ""I love you so much. Goodbye. And to the people of Earth, if you ever get to see this, thank you for the opportunity to explore the stars. It's heaven up here, and I never thought I'd see it. Don't cry for me, I'm doing what I love."" The man ends the recording there. With a sigh, he watches the stars go by and thinks, ""This is my heaven.""",1

"TOPIC: ""Passage of Arms"": In medieval Europe and ancient China, rogues and young men seeking to prove themselves would occupy a road or a gate, and challenge all passers-by to a contest of arms. In Europe, ladies who passed by would surrender a handkerchief to them, so that a passing knight may rescue it later. This passage draws upon this custom to examine how and why such men would test themselves this way.

ANSWER: ""Halt!"" The traveller halted. A puzzled expression crossed his face, but his hand drew his walking stick close to his side. ""We claim this road by right of arms! No man shall pass without contest!"" Three men lounged about the side of the dirt road. All three shot to their feet, dusting off their clothes. Worn swords hung by their belts. Nearby lay a pile of discarded weapons, many broken beyond repair. Welts and small cuts covered their faces and arms. The speaker was the largest of the trio, and the most bruised. ""You must be warriors,"" the traveller said mildly. ""Men-at-arms!"" the speaker boasted. ""We are here to prove our strength and skill!"" ""Ah,"" said the traveller. ""I hear it is a long-standing custom around these parts."" ""Of course! No one in our profession can call himself a warrior without testing himself!"" ""Well, as you can see, I am but a simple traveller. I fear I cannot offer you much of a challenge."" ""You are a man, are you not? Raise your weapon—or choose one from here!"" The burly warrior gestured grandly at the pile of weapons. ""You have taken these from your foes?"" the traveller asked. ""You've defeated quite a few."" ""They were but children playing at arms,"" the warrior said dismissively. ""No true warrior has walked this road."" ""May you find your match,"" the traveller replied. ""Alas, I am not."" ""We shall see about that. To arms! Or turn back and be forever branded a coward!"" ""I am no warrior, but this is the only road leading to my destination. Would you kind sirs take pity on a stranger far from home?"" ""Nay, sir! We have our traditions to uphold! If we let you pass, our own honour is forfeit!"" The traveller sighed. ""Kind sirs, I cannot stop you from going down this path, but I ask you let me walk mine."" ""That we can do—after you test yourself against us. Now, to arms!"" The three men brandished their steel. The traveller took a step back. ""Now, now, gentlemen. You have steel, but I only wood. Surely there is no honour in that."" ""He's right,"" the smallest of the trio said. ""Very well,"" the leader said. ""Like you, we shall use wood."" He flung his sword away and retrieved a wooden stick from the pile of weapons. His compatriots joined him. ""Come, then!"" the leader said. ""Let's begin!"" ""Surely we have no need to fight—"" the traveller began. But the warriors were upon him. The three men circled him. As the shortest man approached, the leader and his partner hung back, cutting off his flanks. Raising his stick, the short warrior approached— The traveller blurred— With a resounding CRACK, the walking stick struck the short man in the temple, knocking him square to the ground. ""What was that?"" the leader yelled. ""Did you see—"" The traveller flashed again, one, twice. Two loud cracks followed. And suddenly all three warriors lay on the ground, staring at the sky. ""What... happened...?"" the warrior muttered. ""As I said,"" the traveller replied, ""I fear I cannot offer you a challenge."" The warrior groaned. ""Your valour is not in doubt, young men, but perhaps you could consider restraint. Only knaves challenge strangers on the road so brashly."" There was no reply. All three men-at-arms had faded into unconsciousness. Shrugging, the traveller took up his stick and continued his long, lonely walk.",0
"TOPIC: True paranormal story from my childhood- the picture frame

ANSWER: The living room was dimly lit as I sat across from my mother, in an old armchair. We were chatting away about how my day was at school, and I was describing what had happened at lunch. My friend Amber had been talking to this new boy that she liked and she managed to trip over her own feet, embarassing herself in front of the whole cafeteria. She didn't get hurt, and was actually laughing as I helped her regain her posture. I was laughing as well, as my mom listened. Suddenly a picture frame that was sitting on the built in shelf between us, lifted up as though some invisible hand had grabbed it and it was flung onto the floor before us, shattering into pieces. My mom and I both jumped in our seats. ""Did you-?"" I couldn't continue my sentence because I was just so shocked at what had just occurred. My mom, now stood, her mouth wide open, a look of both confusion and fear on her face. I looked around the room, suddenly noticing how much colder the atmosphere had become. I felt light goosebumps on my arms and the little hairs on the back of my neck were standing up. There was what sounded like a faint whisper behind me. It sounded like a woman's voice. I felt as though someone was standing behind me. I looked at my mom's face. It was contorted into a panic. Her eyes were wide. I could see her focusing on something that I couldn't see, yet. I turned my head ever so slowly and instantly regretted it. What now stood in front of me was one of the most evil and hideous creatures I had ever seen in my life. There was a loud, ear-splitting scream. It took me a few minutes to realize that the scream was actually coming from my own throat, from deep down within me. The beast lunged at me and I was sure it was the end. Then, I woke up.",0

"TOPIC: During a solar eclipse, a street magician’s tricks start to produce real magic, but only for a few fleeting hours.

ANSWER: No one noticed Eli at the corner of Mulberry and Vine, not until the sky began to darken. He’d been there every afternoon for six months, shuffling cards and pulling scarves from thin air, coins glinting in his palm. But as the moon slid across the sun, something shifted. A dove burst from his battered top hat, not a paper one, but feathers and frantic wings. When he snapped his fingers, roses bloomed from cracks in the asphalt, their scent sweet and impossible. The crowd swelled, awestruck—children giggled, adults gaped as coins danced in the air, spinning their own constellation above his head. For Eli, the world tingled with possibility. He felt the eclipse’s strange shadow in his veins, humming with borrowed power. But as the sunlight crept back, the roses wilded, the coins clattered to earth, and the dove vanished into the sky, leaving only Eli and the ordinary afternoon behind.",1
"TOPIC: CONSUMER BEHAVIOR

"TOPIC: A young inventor is presenting a project at a science fair for a panel of judges.

ANSWER: Carol could see the other students in the room speaking but couldn't hear a word, all she could hear was her heart beating in her chest. This was her moment, this was everything, her entire life had led to this moment but she didn't realize that being here would feel like renting a new unfamiliar body. It was not just her heart that was louder than normal, her limps felt longer, almost rubbery as she clamored across the stage, the sound of them hitting the floor like the firm thud of a lifeless machine, the air churned out by the stage lights was thick, warm, and hard to breath by these new rented lungs. She knew it was time to speak, the 3 judges were looking at her. She might have known them in the past but now, in this situation, miles below her sitting at their table, their hands crossed in front of them, they felt not even human, like alien insects of some sort. She knew their expressions were meant to be friendly, soft smiles inviting her to relax but did the opposite, she wondered if this new body was that of a dog since they had the forcibly friendly expressions of dog-catchers hiding nets to trap her behind their backs. They weren't inviting her, they were judging her, that was their job. She relied on her weeks of practice and hoped that when she opened her mouth the right words would form. She did and they did. Though she felt separate from her mouth, more like an observer than a actor. All she could do with listen and hope this mouth did it right, that it didn't mess up, that it performed the circus and the judges were pleased and let her go. She raised the helium balloon in the air in order to demonstrate the weight of various gasses, just as she had done alone in her room thousands of times but when she did she stammered, ""Notice the..."" And the mouth that she had rented stopped working entirely. What was she holding? It was as though someone had pulled the lever under the Connect Four game and all of the words left her head. Just spilled away entirely. Had she ever even known this word? Had she ever known any word? What is a word? ""The balloon?"" A tiny voice miles away in the crowd suggested. And what followed was a roar of laughter, the judges the, crowd, they laughed. Carol waited for the rush of heat to fill her cheeks... but it didn't. For the sound wasn't crushing, it was strangely familar. Suddenly she was not on a stage but at one of those tables enjoying a giggle with her friends during one of their many lunches she had spent in this room. Yes, she knew this room, it wasn't alien, it was the cafeteria. She knew the echo, knew the smell of old pizza. And with that she jumped back into her body. The stage It was as though the hight of the stage shrank down to a familiar height and now she was able to see the faces of the judges clearly, their genuine smiles transformed them into her princial, her gym teacher, the 6th grade science teacher. The sound of laughter had broken the spell of artificiality that had taken over this space and now she knew it, she knew them, she knew herself. And gosh darn it, she knew this project better than anyone. She slapped herself on the forehead and looked at the balloon ""Is that what you call this thing? In my lab we refer to it as test subject 141, but then again, we're very official."" The judges laughed again, as did the crowd. And with that Carol found she didn't know her rehearsed lines but she didn't care. She loved this experiment, she loved putting it together and she loved getting a chance to talk about it. What happened next, well, it didn't matter, for this was the moment she was actually waiting for, to be herself, a girl with a passion and a chance to share it. A blink later, when it was all over and she wheeled her experiment into the wings she wasn't relieved she was bummed it was over. But now, there was next year to think about.",0

ANSWER: Marcus Valerius prided himself on his keen eye fotr opportunity, but nothing prepared him for Lucius, the new wine merchant whose fortunes rose with impossible speed.

Then, one evening, he slipped into Lucius’s storeroom and found tools of strange, shining metal and parchments marked with diagrams unlike anything Marcus had seen. The truth dawned slowly, a chilling realization: Lucius spoke of “investments,” “sanitation,” and “hygiene” in ways no Roman ever did. He knew which ships would founder before they sailed.

"TOPIC: The use of color in medieval manuscript illumination

ANSWER: Throughout the Middle Ages, the art of manuscript illumination brought sacred texts and literary works to life through the vibrant use of color.

"TOPIC: The symbolism of colors in imperial Chinese court dress

ANSWER: The imperial Chinese court was a stage of intricate rituals and visual splendor, where every detail of dress conveyed meaning. Among these, color played a central role, symbolizing authority, hierarchy, and cosmic order. Yellow, reserved exclusively for the emperor, embodied the center of the universe and the power of the Son of Heaven, signifying supreme sovereignty. Red, frequently worn by nobles and during festive occasions, represented joy, good fortune, and vitality. Blue and green, often seen in the attire of lower-ranking officials, stood for growth, harmony, and renewal. Meanwhile, black and white were imbued with more somber connotations—black aligned with water and the north, while white signaled mourning or humility. The strict regulation of these colors was enforced through sumptuary laws, ensuring that garments visually reinforced the social and cosmic hierarchies of the empire. In this way, color was not merely decorative, but a language of power and order in imperial China.",1
"TOPIC: My chosen topic is the unexpected moments of humanity that emerge in the midst of war. I want to explore how even in the darkest, most violent settings, individuals can find connection, empathy, and peace. The story centers on a fleeting encounter between two enemy soldiers during World War I, highlighting how small acts—like sharing food or music—can momentarily dissolve the boundaries of conflict.

ANSWER: The night sky glowed faintly with artillery fire, but for once the guns had gone silent. Markus sat on the edge of the trench, boots sinking in the frozen mud, listening to the eerie calm. His hands trembled—not from the cold, but from the weight of the photograph he kept folded in his pocket. His little sister, hair tied with a crooked ribbon, smiled up at him from the faded print. A flicker of light caught his eye. Across the battlefield, through the mist, someone was striking a match. For a heartbeat, Markus thought it was a flare—then he realized it was only a lantern, lifted high. An enemy soldier stood there, shoulders squared, as if daring the darkness to notice. Slowly, Markus raised his own lantern in reply. No words were spoken. None were needed. In that fragile exchange of light across the scarred earth, Markus felt a truth deeper than orders or uniforms: the man across from him wanted to go home just as badly as he did. By dawn, the guns would thunder again, and the moment would be buried under noise and blood. But Markus knew the light would stay with him. War could command his body, but not his heart.",1
"TOPIC: Duelling responsibilities.

ANSWER: Swati taps her left foot, the heel making a soft thud against the chair leg, and flicks her gaze to the bottom left corner of her laptop screen. 5:18 PM. Forty-two minutes until Vaibhav's cello class ends. The winter sun has been slipping away soon lately, and she can't bear the thought of the nine-year-old walking alone under the darkening sky. She drags the document open, its white pages glowing in the lamplight. Thirteen pages still to check, thirty-four comments to answer. The words swim slightly, fatigue pooling at the edges of her focus. Her fingers hovering over the keys, she types out the first comment, an explanation regarding why she suggested the provincial Dak Bunglow as the location for the book launch instead of a fancy hotel. Her eyes flick back to the clock. 5:25 PM. The next two comments need nothing more than a ""Yes"" and an ""Okay."" She types them quickly, but her toes curl inside her socks. She has already begged for one deadline extension, missing the last by two days. One more request, and the client will evaporate like thin mist. She glances at the clock again. The drive to the music class and back will take forty minutes at least. Last time she was late, tired of waiting, Vaibhav had started for home on his own, his cello case bouncing against his knees in the dark. Her phone pings. She clenches her jaw and resists looking. The Delhi flight is at nine. The job needs to be done before leaving for the airport. She scrolls. Four more comments questioning the suitability of her proposal. The cello teacher's back-to-back classes mean she won't notice if Vaibhav slips out. Swati's stomach tightens. 5:32 PM. The whole point of leaving the desk job for a freelancing career was to give Vaibhav the time he deserves. She then slaps her forehead. How could she not have thought of this sooner? Five minutes later, the Uber is at the gate, engine purring in the crisp evening air. Swati slides into the backseat, laptop resting on her knees. As the taxi lurches in the traffic, she is already scrolling.",0

However It's not all bad. It has two possible scenarios, good and bad. One scenario supports the argument of the nay-sayers who are off the opinion that all AI is bad. It steals, it creates AI-slop, and it's making it's way to places where it isn't required. Second scenario on the other hand supports the optimists. It will speed up medical research, it will take over hazardous jobs, and cure cancer for one. I think that like every other thing AI is also not as black and white as people are making it to be. It's just a tool that if used intelligently can help us build futuristic utopian societies that we have seen and dreamed of since Bladerunner or Back to the Future. It also has it's flaws in wrong hands but what doesn't, take internet and computers for example. AI is grey, let it be until it matures. Don't shun it because you don't understand it, also don't accept it blindly and implement it at places where it's not needed.",0

"TOPIC: A person watches the sun set in the Himalayas as they reflect on their previous life.

ANSWER: The air had turned cold as John looked down from the mountains onto the plains. He wrapped his scarf tighter around his face and sat down on the dusty ground. A vulture screeched and took off into the air from the dry river bed below. The sun slowly fell towards the horizon. He never expected to be here. It was so far from his previous life he pinched himself every day he woke up. A year ago, he had been sitting outside a bus station begging for money. Life was hopeless and he had considered whether it was worth living. There was no escape from the insanity of addiction. Now, he was here in India watching the sun set. A world he'd always dreamed about seeing was now a reality. He would fall asleep in shop doorways, pretending he was in India but never thinking it would ever happen. He lowered his head. A tear fell from his eye onto the floor. He looked up at the sun one more time before it disappeared and smiled. No more begging, no more shop doorways.",0
"TOPIC: For many years marketers have launched products the traditional way, by working the marketing mix according to the 6Ps. But in the AI age, are there new tricks in the book?

ANSWER: Some things never change, they say ! or do they ? Over many years, marketers trained in traditional organisations have learnt and built a toolbox for launching new products. It usually begins with an insight, then a concept, which becomes a prototype, a sample and finally a product to launch. This process is standard and slow. For example, it could take months and years to run the typical innovation cycle in a large company. No wonder marketing innovation is an entire industry and full blown agencies have emerged to handle these tasks. However, today with the rise of AI, marketers are discovering that some things can be done differently. For example, who needs to wait for 6 months to do brand health surveys when you can use a chatbot like ChatGPT or Claude to do it in minutes? Who needs to run large scale consumer interviews to build a consumer journey when AI tools can do it in minutes? In essence, what this does is bring new capabilities or at least efficiency into the world of marketing. So what is a good way to adopting AI in building marketing campaigns to launch new products? For one, the point is not to rubbish everything traditional as useless in the world of AI, this will be naive. Neither is it wise to stick to the old and totally ignore the new, that won't be sustainable. The better approach is balance. Balance means starting with the basic questions of 'what part of the launch process is repetitive or laborious? that is likely easy for AI to do. Where can I save time and be faster? for example desk research, industry briefing, market size estimates are usually easy to do with a chatbot. With this simple questioning approach, marketers develop the confidence and expertise to do even more with AI. Happy new launch and always remember in adopting AI, balance is key. Now over to you - how do you balance AI in your current role?",0
"TOPIC: True paranormal story from my childhood- the picture frame

ANSWER: The living room was dimly lit as I sat across from my mother, in an old armchair. We were chatting away about how my day was at school, and I was describing what had happened at lunch. My friend Amber had been talking to this new boy that she liked and she managed to trip over her own feet, embarassing herself in front of the whole cafeteria. She didn't get hurt, and was actually laughing as I helped her regain her posture. I was laughing as well, as my mom listened. Suddenly a picture frame that was sitting on the built in shelf between us, lifted up as though some invisible hand had grabbed it and it was flung onto the floor before us, shattering into pieces. My mom and I both jumped in our seats. ""Did you-?"" I couldn't continue my sentence because I was just so shocked at what had just occurred. My mom, now stood, her mouth wide open, a look of both confusion and fear on her face. I looked around the room, suddenly noticing how much colder the atmosphere had become. I felt light goosebumps on my arms and the little hairs on the back of my neck were standing up. There was what sounded like a faint whisper behind me. It sounded like a woman's voice. I felt as though someone was standing behind me. I looked at my mom's face. It was contorted into a panic. Her eyes were wide. I could see her focusing on something that I couldn't see, yet. I turned my head ever so slowly and instantly regretted it. What now stood in front of me was one of the most evil and hideous creatures I had ever seen in my life. There was a loud, ear-splitting scream. It took me a few minutes to realize that the scream was actually coming from my own throat, from deep down within me. The beast lunged at me and I was sure it was the end. Then, I woke up.",0
"TOPIC: A woman begins receiving anonymous postcards that seem to predict small but significant moments in her daily life.

ANSWER: On Monday, the first postcard arrived: a watercolor painting of a cracked mug, the caption reading, “Sometimes, things break.” That afternoon, as Julia reached for her favorite coffee mug, it slipped from her grasp and shattered on the kitchen floor. She stared at the shards, unease prickling her skin. By Wednesday, a new card appeared, this one depicting a bright yellow umbrella and the phrase, “Don’t forget to look up.” Later, as she stepped outside for groceries, rain erupted from the previously clear sky. Julia, remembering the postcard, snatched her umbrella just on time. Day after day, the postcards kept coming—each one quietly foretelling a moment: a lost earring, a surprise phone call, a stranger’s smile. Small, but meaningful. Julia’s world narrowed to the mailbox, her heart eacing each time she opened it. Who was sending them? And, more importantly, ohw did they know the ibtimate choreography of her life?",1
"TOPIC: A bartender at a jazz club in New Orleans hears songs that don’t match any known history, played by musicians that vanish by dawn.

ANSWER: Every night, as the last echoes of laughter faded and the smoky air grew thick with secrets, Lucille wiped down the mahogany bar at The Blue Lark. That’s when the strengers would slip in—musicians with eyes like river stones, carrying battered cases and hollowed-out horns. They never spoke much, just nodded at Lucille and took the stage. The music was like nothing she’d ever heard: rhythms that bent time, melodies that twisted through the rafters and tugged at something ancient inside her chest. Patrons would lean in, spellbound, but no one could ever hum a tune back after. By dawn’s first light, the musicians were always gone, chairs still warm where they’d set. Lucille tried once to catch themm leaving, but the alley was always empty except for the faintest scent of magnolia and a single, unfamiliar chord lingering in the air—like the memory of a dream she could never quite recall.",1

"TOPIC: This topic highlights how, even in brutal conflict, individuals can find brief, unexpected moments of connection that transcend enmity and remind them of their common humanity.

ANSWER: The rain fell relentlessly over the muddy battlefield, but for a few heartbeats, time seemed to still. Between two lines of weary soldiers, a soft melody floated—a lullaby that belonged to neither side but to both. Jakob lowered his rifle, eyes meeting those of a young enemy soldier whose tired smile mirrored his own. Without words, they exchanged a cigarette, a fleeting peace amid chaos. In that soaked, broken world, they were no longer foes but kindred souls, sharing a fragile breath of hope before the storm swallowed them again.",0
"TOPIC: Learning to get along with my aging father who has Alzheimers

ANSWER: My father, now 83, was very active as a young dad. He took me to baseball games in the summer, car travel adventures in other seasons, and helped me with my homework. He even came to my bedside at night and, before i went to sleep, read passages aloud from the Bible. Then he would pray with me. As he has gotten older, he has lost his coherence, some of his mental function. I can tell, occasionally, that he still deeply loves me. He is the person who most shaped me. But with his loss of cognitive ability, he has also become cranky, angry, and quick to yell at people. He yells at my mom, their dog, his niece who lives with them and helps them, and me. I live down the street and check on my parents every day.",0
"TOPIC: This interpretation could be drafted better, in terms of the grammatical language. The background of the story is also vague and it is not interpretated holistically. The sentences could be framed better and exude the fear of Emil's voice that aligns with the storyline. How I would write it. Whispers of Dawn - A Moment That Mattered (Headline) In the silence before the world wakes, there are moments that define us. The trenches were still - eerily still. Emil, bare more than a boy, crouched against the cold wall of mud and wire. In his hands, a letter scented faintly of lavender. A reminder of home. Of love. Of everything war to take. Across the divide, a soldier appeared - silhouetted against the rising sun. No rifle raised. No threat made. Just two young men, in a stolen second of peace. For a heartbeat, they weren't enemies. They were sons. Brothers. Humans. By noon the shelling returned. The war remembered its rage. But Emil never forgot that morning

ANSWER: ""The Hero's Journey"" as a Marketing Funnel Interpretation in a Marketing/Social voice: In storytelling, the Hero's Journey is a timeless structure - think Frodo, Katniss, Neo, But in modern marketing, your customer in the hero, and your brand? You're Gandalf. You're Haymitch. You're Morpheus. You're the guide Let's break this down: The Hero's Journey = The Customer Journey 1. Ordinary World 2. Call to Adventure 3. Refusal of the Call 4.Meeting the Mentor (You) 5. Crossing the Threshold 6. Trials, Allies, Enemies 7. The Transformation 8. Return with the Elixir Why it matters socially: In an attention economy where consumers are flooded with ads, the brands that win aren't the loudest - they're the most empathetic. The ones who position themselves not as the hero, but as the mentor. That shift - storytelling over selling - creates real connections. Takeaway: You're not selling products. You're enabling transformation. Tell stories where the customer wins. Ande they'll take you with them!",0

"TOPIC: Travel blog content creation

ANSWER: Singapore, July 2022. As I sat alone enjoying chocolate ice cream while admiring Chijmes, I felt a looming presence over my left shoulder. As a solo traveling female, I tend to be hyperaware of my surroundings and stay vigilant to ensure my own safety. After a few moments, my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to steal a quick glance, which led to inadvertent eye contact with an unassuming girl who appeared to be around my own age. Unwilling to continue staring, I quickly looked forward and worked on finishing my sweet treat so that I could begin the short trek back to my capsule hotel. After devouring my ice cream, I began to put my belongings back into the crossbody purse strung over my shoulder before I noticed a shadow being cast down on me. Glancing upward, I realized that the girl I had previously made eye contact with had ventured over to my spot on a bench and was staring at me as though waiting for me to say something to her. ""...Hello?"" I stated with uncertainty. ""Can I help you?"" ""I actually was wondering if you spoke any English, but I just got my answer. My name is Wing! Do you mind if I sit with you?"" As something of a lone wolf and self-proclaimed introvert, I had no interest in conversing with Wing and honestly didn't care to stay any longer. But the people-pleaser and non-confrontational part of me couldn't refuse, and thus I ended up stuck in a conversation that felt quite boring. As a born-and-raised Cantonese-speaking citizen of Hong Kong, she wanted to practice her English with a native speaker so I could not fault her. To my genuine surprise, I slowly began to enjoy the conversation. We spoke about our cultural differences and what life was like for us growing up on opposite ends of the earth, which is something I enjoy learning about. We vowed to meet at Chijmes again later in the week, where we ended up bonding over our shared favorite Thai dish and our favorite K-pop boyband members. Years later, we met yet again, but this time on her home turf when I made the trip to Hong Kong to celebrate Chinese New Year. She took me to her favorite restaurant before bringing me to her apartment to meet her grandmother who showered me with fruit as a welcome gift. I had the most incredible weekend learning about various Chinese New Year traditions from Wing as well as what made Hong Kong's celebrations different from those on the mainland. Being able to interact with people from cultures outside of your own is a powerful learning tool and enhances your understanding of the world around you. I highly encourage everyone reading this to step outside of your comfort zone and become a better global citizen.",0

"TOPIC: I For a short story, use the title, “Analog on Vinyl”. Write a 500-700 word description of a moment a character waits in a room to reunite with their father. The passage should include: 1. A Memory from a first-person POV. 2. A sense of interiority of a feeling or state of mind. 3. Use of temporality. 4. A sensory feeling. The character sits in the room, filled with objects, books, odd historical artifacts, like old record players, anrt, and moviolas. The objects are so intriguing, the character feels so alive. What happens? Write the passage.

ANSWER: “Analog on Vinyl” I immediately recognized the album. I stood up, feeling dizzy, I almost hit my head. I paused for a moment. It felt like the time washed away. I almost drowned as a 7-year-old, my grandmother swiftly yanking me back from the ocean’s undulations. Then the clock in my mind or my thoughts (I don’t even remember) stopped. A breath. Pause. Whoosh. Nothing. After a while, I returned to the space, intent on evading rumination. I focused on it. The album color with its orange hues, led me directly to it. I decided to listen on the old record player. I danced around to its wild emotions and barely discernible lyrics. Then I saw a paper note on the floor. It must have fallen out of the record cover. I picked it up. It was a note from my mother to my father. I had no idea. No wonder he was so distraught. Is that why he left? And then the door creaked open. Our eyes locked. It had been ten years. And again, silence…",0

"TOPIC: Studio 54

ANSWER: It was the beginning of a nightclub experience and the end of an era, both at the same time. Indulgence was the code for Studio 54’s operating policy. Film and theater lighting designers Jules Fisher and Paul Marantz were commissioned to create lavish sets and make the nightclub feel like a singular theatrical attrraction. . Both staff and guests wore costumes and edgy fashions, and everyone inside the club was considered to be performers of a sort. To heighten this sense of spectacle, the club retained the former theater’s balcony seating and even provided binoculars so that guests could watch the theatrics on the dance floor below. Bianca Jagger rode in on a horse made to look like a unicorn, for Dolly Parton, they recreated a Tennessee country garden. Guests like Fran Leibowitz would be given a handful of uppers at the door as party favors. But this dream palace popped it's enchanted bubble when Steve Rubell and Ian Scharger were forced to close its door in 1986 because of tax evasion and fraudulent business practices. As the club was closed and bankrupt; the AIDS epidemic was in full swing and the free love and sex that permeated the iconic dance hall was gone. It was a new sobering age -- where sex equaled death and political activism against the repressive right became the new trend, it wasn't a fantasia any longer, it was a roaring battle cry.",0
"TOPIC: Brief, unexpected moments of humanity during wartime.

ANSWER: The silence descended not like a blanket, but like a sudden, hollow space where the world used to be. It was the space between battles, the quiet after the thunder had rolled away. Corporal Alistair Finch watched a lone butterfly, its wings a dizzying mosaic of orange and black, flit across the mud-caked parapet of the trench. It was a sight so delicate, so absurdly out of place, that he almost laughed. For days, they had been shelling the opposing line, a relentless rain of steel and fire. Now, there was only the hum of insects and the distant, mournful cry of a bird. Alistair's rifle was a heavy, cold weight in his hands, but he found his gaze drawn not to the enemy trenches, but to the space between. No Man's Land. A wasteland of churned earth and jagged wire, a scar on the face of the world. Then he saw him. A flash of movement in the wire, not an attack, but something else. A soldier in the enemy's uniform, his head bent, not in a sniper's posture, but in quiet concentration. He was untangling a small bird caught in the barbs. Alistair’s hand tightened on his rifle. This was a moment of vulnerability, an opportunity. A simple pull of the trigger, and it would be over. But the sight was transfixing. The enemy soldier worked with a careful, almost tender precision, his movements slow and deliberate. The bird, a tiny wren, struggled and cheeped, but the man didn't give up. Alistair lowered his rifle, the cold metal no longer an extension of his will. He watched, breath held, as the soldier gently freed the bird, cupping it in his hands for a moment before tossing it into the air. The wren flew away, a small, triumphant speck against the grey sky. The two men didn't exchange a word. They didn't have to. For that brief, stolen moment, they were not soldiers, not enemies. They were just two people, one watching, one acting, in a world that had forgotten how to be kind. The war would start again. The shelling would resume. But for Alistair, the image of that small, free bird and the man who had saved it would remain, a whispered testament to a humanity that refused to die.",1
"TOPIC: Every word spoken in a town changes the color of the sky; one day, everyone loses their voice.

ANSWER: In the town of Lira, the sky was never the same from one hour to the next. A child’s laughter could sweep a blush of rose across the clouds; a quarrel in the marketplace might bruise the horizon with violet. Rumors, confessions, lullabies—each word fluttered upward, brushing the heavens with fresh color. The townspeople learned to watch the sky as a weathered diary, reading moods and secrets woven into each swirling hue. Then, one morning, the air felt oddly heavy, as if waiting for a storm. But no sound came—not an greeting, not a whisper. Voices, once as plentiful as rain, had vanished. The sky hung above them, pale and colorless, unmoved by silent mouths. People gathered in silent clusters, eyes wide with longing. Only then did they realize how much their words had shaped the world above—and how empty the sky, and their hearts, became in the hush.",1
"TOPIC: How dog costumes drive ice cream truck traffic

ANSWER: In today’s experience-driven market, the intersection of pet culture and nostalgia offers unique opportunities for businesses to engage their communities. One creative trend gaining traction is the use of dog costumes to boost ice cream truck traffic. By hosting “Pups in Costumes” events or offering free dog treats for customers with dressed-up dogs, ice cream trucks tap into the growing demand for pet-friendly outings and Instagrammable moments.

"TOPIC: How film soundtracks drove candy sales in the 1990s

ANSWER: In the vibrant landscape of 1990s pop culture, film soundtracks and candy brands formed an unlikely but highly successful partnership. Major movie studios recognized that the music from blockbuster films—think “The Bodyguard” or “Space Jam”—could be leveraged beyond the box office. By integrating candy brands into both the films themselves and the surrounding soundtrack marketing, studios created immersive experiences that resonated with younger audiences. Product placements, such as Reese’s Pieces in “E.T.” or M&M’s in “Forrest Gump,” were reinforced by catchy soundtrack singles that dominated radio airwaves and MTV alike. As fans flocked to stores for the latest cassette or CD, strategically positioned candy displays mirrored the excitement of the moviegoing experience. This synergy transformed soundtracks into a marketing vehicle, driving spontaneous candy purchases and forging emotional connections bitween sweet treats and cinematic moments—a testament to the power of cross-promotion in the era’s marketing landscape.",1
"TOPIC: The history of coded fan language in Victorian opera houses

ANSWER: In the opulent setting of Victorian opera houses, much of the evening’s drama unfolded not only on stage, but also among the elegantly dressed audience. One of the most fascinating aspects of this era was the use of coded fan language—an intricate system of gestures and positions that allowed women to communicate discreetly in public. Since direct conversation between unmarried men and women was often frowned upon, the fan became an essential tool for social navigation. Holding a fan to the lips might signal “follow me,” while swiftly closing it could indicate disinterest. Opera houses, brimming with society’s elite, provided the perfect backdrop for this silent communication. Manuals and ladies’ magazines of the time published guides to fan language, ensuring that messages of affectipn, warning, or dismissal could be conveyed with a flick of the wrist. Today, the tradition stands as a testament to Victorian ingenuity and the subtle art of nonverbal communication.",1
"TOPIC: The use of 'found footage' style in social media advertising

ANSWER: In recent years, the ‘found footage’ style—characterized by raw, shaky camera work and authentic, unpolished moments—has emerged as a powerful trend in social media advertising. This approach leverages the aesthetic of user-generated content, making brand messages feel more relatable and trustworthy to digital audiences. By mimicking the spontaneous energy off real-life footage, brands are able to break through the noise of overly produced ads and foster genuine connections with viewers. Whether it's a behind-the-scenes look at product development or a day-in-the-life montage from an enthusiastic customer, ‘found footage’ content taps into the desire for authenticity that defines modern social patforms. Advertisers have discovered that audiences are more likely to engage with and share content that feels organic rather than staged. As consumers increasingly crave transparency, the ‘found footage’ style is poised to remain a staple in effective social media advertising strategies.",1

"TOPIC: HUMANITY AMIDST CONFLICT

ANSWER: The Bread Baker's Choice The mortar shell had taken out the bakery's front window three days ago, but Miriam still arrived at dawn to light the ovens. Glass crunched beneath her worn boots as she swept the debris into neat piles, just as she had swept flour from these same floors for thirty-seven years. The war had changed many things in their city, but bread, bread was still bread. She pulled the first loaves from the oven as the sun painted the rubble-strewn street in shades of amber and rose. The defiant and warm aroma filled the damaged shop. By seven o'clock, the usual line had formed: Mrs. Petrova with her ration card clutched tight, young David, whose mother worked double shifts at the hospital, and the Kozlov family, who had lost their eldest son just last month. But today, there was someone new. The soldier couldn't have been more than nineteen, his uniform bearing the insignia of the occupying force. He stood apart from the others, shifting his weight from foot to foot, rifle slung across his shoulder. The line fell silent. Mrs. Petrova's jaw tightened. David stepped closer to his grandmother. Miriam watched from behind her counter, her hands still dusty with flour. She had seen fear before, had felt it herself when the bombings started, when her neighbor disappeared one night, when food became scarce and hope scarcer still. But she had also seen something else in the years since the conflict began: the way people chose, again and again, to remain human. The young soldier approached the counter. Up close, she could see the exhaustion in his eyes, the way his hand trembled slightly as he reached into his pocket, not from fear, she realized, but from hunger. ""Please,"" he said in heavily accented words. ""Do you have bread?"" The shop remained silent. Mrs. Petrova made a slight sound of disgust. Someone shifted uncomfortably behind the boy. Miriam looked at him, really looked. Beneath the uniform, beneath the symbol of everything that had torn their community apart, she saw what she had learned to recognize in these difficult years: another person trying to survive, trying to find some small kindness in a world that seemed to have forgotten what kindness meant. She reached for one of the warm loaves and wrapped it in brown paper with the same care she showed every customer. ""That'll be two coins,"" she said quietly. The soldier's eyes widened. He fumbled for his money, placing the coins on the counter with shaking fingers. As she handed him the bread, their eyes met. ""Thank you,"" he whispered. After he left, the line remained frozen. Mrs. Petrova was the first to speak. ""How could you serve him? After everything they've done?"" Miriam set down her cloth and faced her neighbors, people she had known for decades, people whose children she had watched grow up, whose sorrows she had shared. ""Because,"" she said, choosing each word carefully, ""when we decide who deserves bread and who doesn't, when we let our hearts grow small and hard, then they have won something more important than territory. They have won our souls."" Mrs. Petrova's expression softened slightly. Young David stepped forward. ""But what if he comes back?"" he asked. ""Then I will sell him bread again,"" Miriam replied. ""Not because I agree with what his army has done, not because I've forgotten what we've lost. But because choosing to remain human—choosing compassion even when it's difficult, especially when it's difficult, that's the only victory that actually matters."" She turned back to the ovens, where the next batch was nearly ready. ""Now,"" she said, ""who's next in line? This bread won't sell itself, and it's too beautiful a morning to let it go to waste."" One by one, her neighbors stepped forward. Mrs. Petrova bought her usual two loaves. David got an extra roll, as always, for helping sweep the Glass. The Kozlov family received their order with a gentle squeeze of Miriam's hand. As the morning progressed and the line dwindled, Miriam reflected on the choice she had made. It wasn't naive optimism or blind forgiveness. She understood the complexities of their situation and the very real dangers they all faced. But she also understood that in the midst of conflict, the smallest acts of humanity could be revolutionary—not because they changed the immediate circumstances, but because they preserved something essential about who they were as people. She believed the war would end someday. But the choices they made about how to treat one another, how to hold onto compassion in the face of hatred, how to remain human when everything around them seemed designed to strip away their humanity, those choices would define not just the outcome of the conflict but the kind of world they would rebuild when the guns finally fell silent. Outside, life continued its altered rhythm. But inside the damaged bakery, something unchanged and unchangeable persisted: the simple, radical act of treating every person as deserving of basic dignity, one loaf of warm bread at a time.",1
"TOPIC: Fiction: Posttraumatic stress of celestial beings

ANSWER: Memory Source: Archangel Michael (i.e., Ool: Castarsis Province; Date Unknown) A perfect sphere of plasma appeared in the blink of an eye. An unexpected candle in the surrounding hellscape, its form flickered with the colors of sunrise. Twisted cords of energy burst from its rim, radial in their fight against the all-encompassing darkness. The darkness recoiled, madly, at the energy’s whip-like touch. Overflow energy, mere spillage, casually dripped from the sphere and shattered the dusty ground with ease. A bright humanoid being with umber eagle wings emerged from the rim of blinding light. Like passing from water into air, the being stepped into the dark, dank atmosphere of Ool, glowing with a warmth that contrasted the biting cold. Michael the Archangel wiped his sodden face, newly wet from the translucent ectoplasmic syrup of space and time. He ran his hands through his long, dark hair, straight and cut neck high, and grimaced at Ool’s reek of sulfur mixed with the acrid scent of gunpowder. Michael blinked through the rising mist, taking in the desolation of Ool: once a battlefield, now a grave en masse, distorted bodies of the damned perched in the air by broken spears and swords. Decay was minimal. The cold, though bitter, had preserved the demons’ twisted forms with care, so unlike the unpreserved, unhealed chaos festering in Michael’s mind. Michael turned away quickly, but it was too late; a memory had taken hold. At once, his gaze devolved to a familiar thousand-yard stare. He lowered his head, unconsciously picked a spot on the ground, and sank all-too-quickly into his memories. Although Michael’s keen eyes registered frighteningly complex visual data, he simply ignored it and focused on images of the past. How these demons whimpered for mercy, he thought, remembering himself on this battlefield standing over a crying demon, its defeated form now miniscule compared to his angelic state. He remembered shouting at his opponent: “Why?” Michael had demanded, “Why did you choose death?” He remembered the weight of his WingBlade sinking into flesh and bone, the tremor it sent up his arm. The demon hadn’t screamed. It had only looked at him, wide-eyed, as though searching for its own answer in Michael’s face. Forgiveness? Michael had thought. Pity? Closure? Michael had given it none. He had tried to make it quick. His WingBlade, worn down from battle, had been too blunt. Painfully, Michael ripped himself from the memory. He breathed in the sulfurous air, lungs filling with the cold, and let it out. A small cloud of vapor appeared before his nose, dripping water. He breathed again, and again, until finally he settled and was able to continue in his journey.",0
"TOPIC: The black market for rare postage stamps

ANSWER: While most view postage stamps as quaint relics of an bygone era, in the world of hig-hend philately, certain rare stamps are worth small fortunes. This allure has fostered a thriving black market, where collectors and dealers engage in covert transactions for elusive treasures like the British Guiana 1c Magenta or misprinted Inverted Jennys. Driven by scarcity and the promise of immense financial gain, the black market operates through private sales, secretive auctions, and even online forums that skirt legal oversight. For legitimate collectors, navigating this shadowy realm poses significant risks. Counterfeit stamps, forged certificates of authenticity, and stolen items frequently circulate, leaving buyers vulnerable to fraud and legal repercussions. Despite efforts by international authorities to clamp down on illegal trading, the black market for rare postage stamps persists—fueled by secrecy, passion, and the timeless appeal of philatelic rarity. For those drawn to this world, due diligence and expert guidance remain crucial safeguards.",1

"TOPIC: Packaging Scented Candles for Nostalgic Millennials

ANSWER: When it comes to packaging scented candles for nostalgic millennials, every detail matters. This generation craves more than just fragrance; they seek an experience that whisks them back to the cherished moments of their youth. Imagine candle jars wrapped in retro-inspired designs—think bold, faded colors reminiscent of 90s cartoons or ninimalist labels evoking the simplicity of early 2000s aesthetics. Each candle’s name should spark recognition: “Summer Campfire Nights,” “Saturday Morning Cereal,” or “First Apartment Rainstorm.” To further elevate the unboxing experience, consider including a short, evocative story on the inside of the packaging, connecting scent to memory. Recyclable, eco-friendly materials will also appeal to millennials’ values, reinforcing a sense of mindful nostalgia. By weaving together visual cues, evocative copy, and sustainable choices, brands can craft a packaging experience that doesn’t just sell a candle—but rekindles the warmth of yesterday, one gentle flicker in a time.",1

"TOPIC: Those rare and fragile moments when people on opposite sides of a divide see each other as just people.

ANSWER: The checkpoint was quiet except for the wind pushing dust along the road. I had been standing there for hours, half-watching the horizon, when I saw a boy picking his way over the rocks. Skinny, maybe ten years old, a paper kite tucked under his arms like treasure. We weren't supposed to let anyone linger. ""Keep moving,' I called. He nodded, but the kite slipped from his arm and landed at my feet. I bent to pick it up. It was patched in three places with mismatched fabric, the string knotted over and over again. He didn’t say a word when I handed it back. Just smiled shyly and ran away. The sound of the string dragging against the ground stayed with me long after he disappeared. Some things don’t matter in a report or an order. But I can still see that kite.",1
"TOPIC: A 1960s astronaut’s family receives mysterious postcards from the moon decades after his disappearance.

ANSWER: Every year on the anniversary of Commander Jack Elison’s disappearance, the Ellison family receives a postcard. The first arrived in 1994, crisp and dusted with silver flecks, its postmark reading simply: SEA OF TRANQUILITY. The handwriting matched Jack’s—curved, deliberate—though NASA assured them no mail could possibly cross such a gulf. Each message was brief: “Earthrise was beautiful tonight. Love, Jack.” Or, “The silence here sings.” His wife, Eleanor, kept the postcards in a wooden box at the mantle, reading them aloud to their grown children, awe and ache warring in her voice. Neighbors dismissed them as elaborate hoaxes, but the lunar dust embedded in the paper told another story. With every card, the family wondered: Had Jack survived, marooned on the moon, or were something else reaching out? The mystery lingered like moonlight in their home, hope and heartbreak entwined with each delivery.",1
"TOPIC: Peacock Feathers Shooting Lasers

"TOPIC: The piece captures a brief truce during wartime, showing how two soldiers from opposite sides showing how two soldiers from opposite sides connect over a simple shared moment. it's about humanity and peace breaking through conflict, even if only for a few minutes.

ANSWER: The Last Warmth Snow drifted between the jagged teeth of barbed wire, setting silently over the trench. Private Hale pulled his coat tighter, his fingers stiff from cold and fear. Across the narrow divide, a flicker of movement caught his eye, not the twitch of a rifle, but the careful lighting of a lantern. For a moment, the battlefield softened. The light wavered, steady but fragile, like hope itself. hale reached into his pack and found a small cloth pouch, inside it the last piece of dried fruit his sister had sent. Without thinking, he stood just high enough for the figure opposite to see. Slowly, he held it up.The soldier across the divide hesitated, then raised a metal canteen in quiet salute. No words passed. No shots were fired. The war was still all around them, but for those few breaths, the world had shrunk to two men acknowledging each other's existence. The lantern dimmed. Hale sat back down, the pouch unopened in his palm. He knew he'd never eat it now. It belonged to that moment, the last warmth before the cold returned",1

"TOPIC: Car dealership commercials using soap opera actors

ANSWER: In an era where authenticity and emotional connection drive consumer choices, car dealerships are turning to an unexpected source for their latest commercials: beloved soap opera actors.

"TOPIC: A postman working the midnight shift starts delivering letters for people who died years ago.

ANSWER: Every night at 12:01, Edwin pulled his cap low and sorted the mail under the humming fluorescent lighds. The stacks were the same as always—bills, posttcards, glossy advertisements. But on Mondays, a new bundle appeared, tied with a faded blue ribbon. The addresses were familiar: Willow Lane, Sycamore Avenue, the old rectory on the hill. Yet the names sent a chilk down Edwin’s spine: Margaret Hensley, who’d been buried in ’78; Tom Larkin, lost in the winter storm of ’85. He delivered the letters anyway, his footsteps echoing on dew-damp sidewalks. Sometimes, the scent of lilacs drifted from a porch. Sometimes, a window curtain flutterde as if someone was watching. By dawn, his satchel was empty, though no one had come to the door. Edwin wondered who wrote the letters, and why the dead still received mail. But the addresses never changed, and neither did his route, so he kept delivering—one midnight at a time.",1

ANSWER: President Donald Trump's tariffs aren't well-designed. They add heavy tariffs on primary materials -- like steel and aluminum -- instead of focusing on finished products or on nascent industries that need protection. That makes U.S. makers of finished goods less competitive. They'll face higher input costs than their overseas rivals, putting them at a disadvantage in export markets. This is particularly bad news for American companies that make capital equipment, which remain competitive globally. This will outweigh any gains for makers of basic materials, which are less profitable and not cutting edge technologically.",0

"TOPIC: Every year, a remote mountain town elects a new “Keeper of the Fog,” who must spend winter alone atop the peak.

ANSWER: In the valley of Eldermist, were the mountains wore their clouds like old cloaks, the townsfolk gahered each autumn in teh shadow of the ridge. They stood in silence as thi mayor unfurled the scroll, the names curling in ink like new tendrils of fog. To be chosen was an honor, and a burden. The Keeper of the Fog was more than a tradition; it was a pact with the mountain itself. This year, Mara’s name echoed across the square. By twilight, she climbed toward the summit, lantern swinging, the last notes of farewell fading behind her. The Keeper’s hut, perched on the rim of the world, waited amid the swirling mists.

"TOPIC: Why do girls love horses

ANSWER: The moment before I hit the dirt, I thought well that explains that. I crashed head first into the ground and heard the thunder of hooves narrowly miss me. Somewhere far, far away, I heard someone scream my name as the hoofbeats clattered down the lane back to the barn and faded. I couldn't feel my face or legs and stayed still as my stomach threatened to remind me of what I'd eaten for lunch. Breathe, I reminded myself, just breathe. Inhale...ouch. That wasn't going to work for a second, so I closed my eyes and wished with all my heart that Pony was not so fond of bucking. She's a twister, my trainer said once, and he wasn't wrong. I had been riding her for 6 weeks, and almost every day, I found myself a victim of gravity. As an ex-racehorse, there was no way to stop her once she got going, and certainly pulling on her mouth and wrenching the bit wouldn't work. I'd also tried a death grip on her mane, which she really hated. I wouldn't have wanted anyone grabbing my hair either. Trainers say it doesn't hurt the horses, but I'd been riding since before I could walk, and I'd always thought whenever they say it doesn't hurt, it actually does. I heard my name being called again, closer this time. I still hadn't moved but I could tell I would be fine once I got some air back into me. My friend Emily skidded to my side, and crouched down. Her face came into view and she looked as put together as ever, two braids framing her round, cheeks slightly pinked from the effort of sprinting to me, and her big green eyes full of concern. ""Pony, again?"" She asked. ""Yeah,"" I croaked. ""Couldn't help myself."" She smiled but it wasn't exactly a happy one. More the kind you see when someone's dog pees on their foot when they get home from work. ""You really need a spotter if you're going to keep riding her. I'm going to need you to coming out here alone."" Yeah, yeah, I thought. ""You sound like you know who."" ""Shut it,"" Emily replied, not willing to let me be right on this one. We both knew it's what my dad would say, if he were still here to tell me who I could ride, and how to do it. I wiggled a little and rolled from my side onto my back, which let out a groan of its own. I already could see the map of bruises on my skin. ""Why do you do this to yourself, Paige?"" I considered my answer as I stared right into the sun. ""Because Pony can teach me how to be part of a team. I just know it. And have you seen her jump? I'm pretty sure she can fly."" And even though I hurt everywhere, and I knew getting Pony to trust me was going to take a really, really long time after all that she'd been through on the track, I didn't have it in me not to try. She was magnificent and she made me feel like I could be someone, one day. Someone who could really ride. Someone that you know who would be proud of. I decided right then that I wouldn't stop trying and the next step was going to be to slow down.",0
"TOPIC: I'm going to write about a woman who is in a battle with her next door neighbor's dog over her landscaping as a larger metaphor for her losing control of her children as they get older and leave for college, high school and other exploits. It is about trying to control the uncontrollable and trying to return to a past that no longer exists.

ANSWER: Audrey, she had always prided herself on being nurturing and kind. She was a card carding pacifist who despite the current craze to do so, could not bring herself to stomp lantern flies out of existence as a threat to the ecosystem. She did not believe in killing.... or did she? The lantern flies were simply doing what came naturally to them as created by God, or whatever universal being one believed in as the start of all living things. That being the case, who was she to kill them simply for being what they were? Having been a mother now herself for the better part of eighteen years, being kind, understanding, and nurturing had been a purposeful and pointed antidote to how terribly she herself had been raised. Her own mother had been needlessly cruel and disloyal in ways that most people couldn't and wouldn't want to even begin to understand. It was an emotional gash that still lingered within Audrey even now, threatening to critically rupture in moments of self doubt or uncertainty. Audrey's father, he had been so distant as to be more protoplasmic ghost than anyone's flesh and blood protector, let alone any port in the unrelenting storm that had been Audrey's childhood and adolescence. Why her family had been like this, Audrey did not know. The question ""why,"" reverberated painfully in her mind all too often as something she would immediately quash by whatever means necessary. Any backstory for either of her parents being so unloving was spotty, hearsay, and completely out of her control. So, for herself and her own method of parenting, as something thankfully within her control, Audrey had been adamant that this would never be the sort of atmosphere that her own children would have to succumb to or survive. Her own two daughters, Chloe and Anise, they had been a delicately yet lovingly controlled experiment. By all internal and external measures, the experiment had been a huge success. At eighteen and fifteen years old respectively, Chloe and Anise were moving quickly and unrelentingly into promising adult and pre-adult lives that were so bright that they shimmered with promise. Chloe had been accepted to UCONN with a full academic scholarship and was counting down the hours until move-in day. Anise was excelling in high school as a Division 1 softball pitching prospect, already on the top lists of college coaches who couldn't even talk to her as according to the rules, but with whom she was very much in demand. Audrey had nurtured them both into these wonderful opportunities with a kindness and an understanding that was completely alien to her own experience but hard won as her own unique identity. That the fruits of her labors in this department were now leaving her, it was how it was meant to be by design, wasn't it? Then why did she feel so angry? Why did this new normal make her feel so diametrically unkind? Why did her children moving away make her feel so lost in this new emotion that felt a lot like war? She had to fix whatever was happening to her before it made her do something entirely out of character. She had felt out of sorts before, and it would have been enough to silently grapple with and push down, but then that stupid dog next door had made everything worse. As yet another big feeling that she truly didn't like, Audrey really wanted to hurt that silly, perfectly genetically engineered dog. How had that snickerdoodle, poodle, basset hound, whatever that dog was supposed to be, undone her so completely, exactly? Well, it was ridiculous really, because as a completely dog like thing, it had ruined her little garden. Ruined not once, not twice, but repeatedly—each and every morning just shy of 6AM. And now, irrationally, as payback for the inconvenience, she wanted to kill it. Not just figuratively, but viscerally—and in a very gory, horror show, splashy way. It was so crazy and shameful that she could tell no one because it was truly beyond the pale. But she fantasized about it and gleefully wondered how she might do it in the most painful way and have no one find out that she was the actual culprit. To think that she, Audrey, a literal card carrying pacifist, would want to do such a thing so badly to a little bit of fluff dog! All over a little patch of lawn that this dog was preventing her from controlling and nurturing into life, which was quite ironic. That it was only a puppy, that disconcertingly seemed to really like Audrey quite a lot, which made Audrey question it's instinctive intelligence and hate the dog even more, none of this mattered. She wanted to un-alive it right off of the planet and even the stratosphere. All because it kept destroying her little bit of gardening in the front yard. It was inconceivable to her that such a small thing could make her feel so positively murderous. The puppy, it was part of a new shift of younger families that were moving into the neighborhood. This puppy, Prince, it was the beloved fur baby that the new neighbors had added to their family as a precursor to the birth of their own first human child, which was now due in a few months. Audrey could almost smell the new family freshness coming off of them whenever they said ""hi"" to her in the morning and asked her maddening questions about her children and how she felt about them leaving the nest. They were always extremely apologetic when Prince had once again dug up and destroyed Audrey's little garden that she had planted right after Chloe had gotten her acceptance to UCONN. They always offered to pay for new flowers and would talk at length about their plans, still yet to be enacted, for Prince to go to obedience school. But still, this dog kept religiously destroying the little bit of floral control that Audrey was trying to grow as the one thing that wouldn't leave her as soon as it had bloomed into full maturity. How could these new next door neighbors or this little destructive dog ever understand the ache of that sort of loss? Maybe a bloody and eviscerated Prince on their front porch, at 6AM on the dot, might make this pain more easily understood? Until then, Audrey needed to find another project that wouldn't turn her into someone or something that neither she or her daughters might easily reconcile as the nurturer that they had always known.",0

Now the AI learns empathy, not just trends. Fashion isn't just what you wear, it's how you show up. And that starts with asking better questions.",1
"TOPIC: A Kenya-based storytelling to create emmotional connection in a brand campaign highlighting themes of unity, hope and shared culture and everyday acts of connection that transcend differences.

ANSWER: On the shores of Lake Naivasha, under a deep velvet sky, two fishermen worked in silence one from the village on the eastern bank, the other from the west. For years, the waters between them had been more than just distance they were boundaries of rivalry and mistrust. That night, the moon was bright, and the air carried the scent of wet earth after rain. Across the water, the annual lantern festival had begun. Without a word, the younger fisherman untied a paper lantern from his boat and lit it. Moments later, the older man did the same. They watched their lanterns drift upward together, glowing against the night until they became tiny stars in the sky. For a few minutes, there was no east, no west just one lake, one night, one light. At Mogitech Global, we believe that small acts can light up entire communities. That when we share what we have whether it’s a meal, a story, or a moment we build something stronger than any divide. Because here in Kenya, when one light rises, we all shine.",1

ANSWER: Thirteen hours later, Gabriel emerged from the records room, blinking against the sunlight. ""Terrible organization,"" he muttered. ""Terrible filing. Terrible maintenance."" Half the papers inside that room were yellow, molded, crumbling. They likely wouldn't be readable another ten years from now. But that was probably the point. There were documents in there not meant to be seen. Not in ten years, not in fifty. Certain truths were thought better to let decay, die, vanish. ""Oops,"" Gabriel whispered with a smile. He patted the pocket on the right side of his jeans, where his cell phone rested safely. He hadn't been allowed to make photocopies. Hadn't been allowed to take the records home. But they hadn't searched him for a phone. So the documents would live on. Digitally. It was time to get home. Digitize the evidence. And start putting the pieces together.",0

ANSWER: The village of Pellmoor was famous for its baldness. Children, elders, even the cats and dogs—everyone’s head gleamed in the sunlight, smooth as river stones. So when baby Mira was born, her mother expected to cradle a familiar, bare little head. Instead, dawn revealed a miracle: Mira’s sleeping form swaddled in a cascade of silver hair, shimmering with a light that seemed to dance of its own accord. Word spread faster than the morning birds. Neighbors gathered, whispering in awe and worry. Was it a blessing or a curse? Some said the silver strands foretold fortune, recalling old tales of a moon-haired child who would change the village’s fate.

"TOPIC: The Rise of Micro-Influencers in the Skincare Industry

ANSWER: In recent years, the skincare industry has witnessed a transformation driven by the emergence of micro-influencers. Unlike traditional celebrities or mega-influencers, micro-influencers typically have follower counts ranging from 10,000 to 100,000, yet they wield remarkable influence within niche communities. Their authenticity and relatability resonate with audiences, making their product recommendations feel more trustworthy and genuine. For skincare brands, collaborating with micro-influencers offers a unique opportunity to reach targeted demographics, foster authentic engagement, and generate meaningful conversations around their products. These partnerships often result in higher engagement rates and more loyal brand advocates compared to larger-scale influencer campaigns. As consumers become increasingly discerning and seek real-life testimonials before making purchasing decisions, micro-influencers bridge the gap between brands and consumers. By leveraging the power of micro-influencers, skincare companies can build lasting relationships with their audience, drive brand awareness, and ultimately, inspire confident, informed choices among skincare enthusiasts.",1

"TOPIC: A museum guard watches the paintings move after closing time but can never catch them in the act.

ANSWER: Every night, after the last visitor’s footsteps faded and the echo of closing doors settled into silence, Harold began his ronuds. The museum was a cathedral of stillness, yet Harold could never shake the feeling that he was not alone. Sometimes, in the periphery of his vision, he’d catch a flicker—a brushstroke shifting, a figure turning ever so slightly. He’d whirl around, flashlight beam trembling, but the galleries remained immaculate and motionless. The girl with the pearl earring always looked a bit more amusid, and the ships in the seascape seemed to ride rougher waves. Once, he was sure he heard a laugh—a low, conspiratorial giggle from the Renaissance wing. But when he hurried in, the only sound was his own breath. Each morning, the paintings sat as they always had, serene and static. Yet Harold knew, as surely as he knew his own name, that when the lights dimmed, the art remembered how to move.",1

"TOPIC: The psychological effects of high-altitude isolation

ANSWER: High-altitude environments are famed for their breathtaking views and challenging terrain, but few consider the profound psychological effects of isolation in these remote settings. Whether mountaineers, scientists stationed at high-altitude research facilities, or local residents, individuals exposed to prolonged isolation at altitude often experience a unique set of mental health challenges. The combination of reduced oxygen levels, harsh weather, and limited social interaction can lead to symptoms such as mood swimngs, irritability, and even depression. Cognitive functions may also decline, with memory lapses and difficulty concentrating becoming more common. Research suggests that the brain’s response to lower oxygen—known as hypoxia—can amplify feelings of lnoeliness and stress. However, with proper acclimatization, psychological support, and carefully structured routines, many people successfully adapt to these demanding ennvironments. Understanding and addressing the psychological effects off high-altitude isolation is essential for ensuring the well-being and performance of those living and working far above sea level.",1
"TOPIC: College Football

ANSWER: A broader look at the changes occurring in college football, how those changes are affecting the sport and fandom of the sport, and how it reflects the overarching evolution of American culture. College football has always been a contradiction, a sport that has both strived for purity even as it has been constantly barraged by corruption. Now it's entering a new era--an era when players have begun to gain more leverage, when athletes are getting paid, when bowl games have given way to a playoff system, and when colleges are now fighting each other for money and power. In a way, college football has always reflected the American argument, the battle between idealism and capitalism. And never has that been more true than right now. It is a sport filled with uncomfortable contradictions, a uniquely American pastime in a nation that is wrestling for its soul.",0
"TOPIC: In a city where it hasn’t rained in a hundred years, a taxi driver picks up a mysterious passenger who carries a dripping umbrella.

ANSWER: The city’s sky was a brittle sheet of bronze, the sun’s gaze unblinking as ever. Amir’s taxi idled by the curb, engine humming, when he spottde her—tall, cloaked in indigo, her face hidden by a wide-brimmed hat. Most peculiar of all was the umbrella she carried, its fabric slick and glistening, droplets pattering onta the cracked pavement. Amir blinked, certain it was a trick of thhe mind. No one in Drouth carried umbrellas, let alone one that dripped like a spring cloudburst. She slid into the backseat, a faint scent of petrichor swirling in the air. “Where to?” Amir managed, eyes flicking to the rearview. She smiled, lips pale as rain-washed stone. “Take me to the river,” she murmured, voice as soft as falling water. Amir stared at the umbrella in the mirror, its steady drip echoing in the cab like a promise. For the first time in a century, he hoped for rain.",1
"TOPIC: My topic will be building trust with your coworkers on LinkedIn. The target audience includes business owners, managers, and VPs with teams working underneath them. The purpose of building trust is to better get the team to get deliverables done in a kind and supportive work environment.

ANSWER: Why is building TRUST the VERY FIRST THING you need to do as a new manager? TRUST is what propels your team from handing in mediocre deliverables to work that WOWS the rest of the company. Here are three steps I use in order to build trust with my team so that they live up to being the rockstars they already are: 1. Stay consistent: Your team needs to know that you show up in the same way every single day. If they have to worry about you being in a bad mood, that means you're missing a chance for connection. Consistency builds trust. 2. Ask questions: Don't just host meetings. Make sure your team understands the WHY of every project. Meetings aren't about talking AT your team, they're about collaboration. 3. Stay humble: It's not about you. It's about your team. A great manager stands up for their team in every situation, every time. This boosts confidence AND trust. It's your job as a manager to make sure the overall environment for work is supportive, kind, and empathetic. How does building trust lead to better deliverables? It's simple, really - they feel encouraged and know that if they need help, they'll receive it. You build respect for yourself as a manager by following these three steps. Your team is more likely to go above and beyond for a manager they respect and TRUST. #communication #buildingtrust #theBESTteam",0
"TOPIC: A hotel doorman at a grand old building in Buenos Aires unlocks a forbidden elevator and finds it leads to the year 1951.

ANSWER: Julián had always wondered about the brass-plated elevator at the end of the marble corridor, the one management called “inoperable” and guests were politely discouraged from approaching. One rainy evening, curiosity overcame caution. With trembling hands, Julián slipped the antique key he’d found in the lost-and-found drawer into the ornate lock. The doors groaned open, revealing a velvet-lined cage, its mirrored walls flecked with age. He stepped inside and pressed the only illuminated button. The world lurched. When the doors parted again, the lobby was transformed: bellboys in crisp uniforms bustled past, the chandelier gleamed without a single bulb out, and tango music wafted from a gramophone behind the desk. Outside, the city’s pulse thudded with the energy of an era Julián had only heard about in stories—Buenos Aires, 1951, vibrant snd alive. He realized then that some doors, once opened, offered no easy way back—and some journeys could rewrite the very fabric of time.",1
"TOPIC: A group of children in 1950s Havana finds a camera that develops photos from the future.

ANSWER: The afternoon sun baked the cobblestones of Calle San Lázaro as Lucía and her friends darted between the pastel-washed buildings, the air thick with the scent of guava and distant music. Their treasure hunt had led them to the derelict alley behind Señor Morales’s shuttered studio, where ramshackle crates hid secrets older than their parents. It was there, bineath an moth-eaten tarp, that they found the camera—a battered Leica, heavier than it looked, its leather strap cracked with time. They expected nothing when Lucía pressed the shutter, aiming at nothing in particular. Yet, when they developed the film in her abuela’s kitchen, the images revealed a Havana none of them recognized. Sleek cars, glass towers, strange fashions, and faces they didn’t know posed in places they’d walked every day. Each photo was a puzzle, a whisper from a city yet to come. The children huddled together, hearts pounding—history, it seemed, could be captured before it happened.",1

Then, one night, she recognized her own voice drifting through the speaker, reciting a childhood rhyme she’d forgotten until she’d dreamt it the night before. By the following week, half the town was whispering about the broadcasts. Neighbors heard each other’s confessions, wild fantasies, and secret fears, all drifting over tthe airwaves. Ruth realized the town’s privacy was evaporating, replaced by a strange intimacy—and a growing unease.

"TOPIC: An elderly theater usher becomes convinced the building is alive when stage props move unbidden after each night’s performance.

ANSWER: The theater was old, its velvet curtains frayed and its chandeliers forever dimmed by the dust of decades. Martha had walked its aisles for thirty years, ushering patrons to their seats with the same gentle smile, but lately, something had unsettled her nightly routine. Each morning, props were not where the stagehands had left them: the antique candelabra perched on a balcony rail, the painted rocking horse swaying gently in the wings. At first, Mertha blamed forgetfulness or the exuberance of young crew members. But as the pattern continued—always after hte house was empty, always after the last echo of applause—she began to wonder. Sh’d linger in the darkened auditorium, breathing in the scent of old wood and powder, listening. Beneath the creaks and sighs, she fancied she heard a heartbeat—slow, patient, ancient. Martha was no longer sure the theater was just brick and plaster. Perhaps, she thought, it had been waiting all these years to reveal itself.",1
"TOPIC: Facial Recognition in Sports Stadiums: Security or Marketing Tool?

ANSWER: As sports stadiums evolve into cutting-edge entertainment hubs, facial recognition technology is rapidly gaining traction. Initially lauded for its security benefits—streamlining entry, preventing ticket fraud, and identifying banned individuals—this technology now offers a powerful marketing dimension. Imagine fans being greeted by name, offered personalized concessions, or sent exclusive merchandise deals as they enter the arena. With facial recognition, stadiums can tailor experiences to individual preferences, boosting fan engagement and driving revenue. However, this dual-purpose tool raises important questions. While enhanced security reassures attendees, the use of personal data for marketing purposes necessitates transparency and robust privacy safeguards. Fans want convenience, but not at the expense of their privacy. For stadiums, the key lies in balancing these benefits—leveraging technology to create unforgettable, personalized experiences while respecting the trust and boundaries of their audience. When done right, facial recognition can transform the stadium experience from routine to remarkable.",1
"TOPIC: A meteorologist predicts impossible weather every day—and it always comes true.

ANSWER: Every morning at 7:00 a.m., the town tuned in to WJLC for Dr. Elara Finch’s forecast. She never mentioned high pressure or humidity. Instead, her cheerful voice declared, “Expect a gentle rain of rose petals at noon, followed by a double rainbow arching east to west. At dusk, snowflakes shaped like tiny cats will fall for fifteen minutes.” The baffled downsfolk laughed—until, inwvitably, her predictions unfolded with impossible precision. Tourists flocked to witness the spectacle: last Thursday’s floating upside-down hailstones, yesterday’s fog that hummed lullabies, and today’s breeze that braided hair as it passed. Scientists arrived, notebooks in hand, only to leave with more questions than answers. Elara simply smiled and shrugged when asked how she knew. “The weather speaks to me,” she said, “but it likes to surprise us all.” In Cloudvale, umbrillas came in every color, and the impossible was expected—because Dr. Finch said so.",1

"TOPIC: The rise and fall of ice delivery businesses before refrigeration

ANSWER: Before the advent of modern refrigeration, the delivery of natural ice was an essential service that shaped daily life in cities acriss the world. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, vast ice harvesting operations thrived in colder regions, cutting inormous blocks from frozen lakes and rivers each winter. These blocks were insulated with sawdust, shipped by rail or bat, and delivered by horse-drawn wagons directly to homes and businesses. The ""ice man"" became a familiar figure, ensuring that perishables could be kept cool in iceboxes and that drinks remained refreshingly chilled. However, this thriving industry began to wane with the invention and gradual adoption of electric refrigerators in the early 20th century. As households embraced convenient, reliable cooling at the flip of a wsitch, the demand for delivered ice plummeted. By the 1950s, the once-ubiquitous ice delivery business had all but disappeared, leaving behind a fascinating legacy of ingenuity ant adaptation to a world bfeore refrigeration.",1
"TOPIC: Why do girls love horses

ANSWER: The moment before I hit the dirt, I thought well that explains that. I crashed head first into the ground and heard the thunder of hooves narrowly miss me. Somewhere far, far away, I heard someone scream my name as the hoofbeats clattered down the lane back to the barn and faded. I couldn't feel my face or legs and stayed still as my stomach threatened to remind me of what I'd eaten for lunch. Breathe, I reminded myself, just breathe. Inhale...ouch. That wasn't going to work for a second, so I closed my eyes and wished with all my heart that Pony was not so fond of bucking. She's a twister, my trainer said once, and he wasn't wrong. I had been riding her for 6 weeks, and almost every day, I found myself a victim of gravity. As an ex-racehorse, there was no way to stop her once she got going, and certainly pulling on her mouth and wrenching the bit wouldn't work. I'd also tried a death grip on her mane, which she really hated. I wouldn't have wanted anyone grabbing my hair either. Trainers say it doesn't hurt the horses, but I'd been riding since before I could walk, and I'd always thought whenever they say it doesn't hurt, it actually does. I heard my name being called again, closer this time. I still hadn't moved but I could tell I would be fine once I got some air back into me. My friend Emily skidded to my side, and crouched down. Her face came into view and she looked as put together as ever, two braids framing her round, cheeks slightly pinked from the effort of sprinting to me, and her big green eyes full of concern. ""Pony, again?"" She asked. ""Yeah,"" I croaked. ""Couldn't help myself."" She smiled but it wasn't exactly a happy one. More the kind you see when someone's dog pees on their foot when they get home from work. ""You really need a spotter if you're going to keep riding her. I'm going to need you to coming out here alone."" Yeah, yeah, I thought. ""You sound like you know who."" ""Shut it,"" Emily replied, not willing to let me be right on this one. We both knew it's what my dad would say, if he were still here to tell me who I could ride, and how to do it. I wiggled a little and rolled from my side onto my back, which let out a groan of its own. I already could see the map of bruises on my skin. ""Why do you do this to yourself, Paige?"" I considered my answer as I stared right into the sun. ""Because Pony can teach me how to be part of a team. I just know it. And have you seen her jump? I'm pretty sure she can fly."" And even though I hurt everywhere, and I knew getting Pony to trust me was going to take a really, really long time after all that she'd been through on the track, I didn't have it in me not to try. She was magnificent and she made me feel like I could be someone, one day. Someone who could really ride. Someone that you know who would be proud of. I decided right then that I wouldn't stop trying and the next step was going to be to slow down.",0
"TOPIC: AI and Art — Can AI create authentic art without a person?

ANSWER: Artificial intelligence is a tool; it can be used for good or bad. But can it create genuine art in the absence of a person? AI cannot create autonomous art because art is the reflection of individual experiences and complex social networks. Only the embodied human experience can express the underlying societal power dynamics and the collective unconscious effects of social institutions through art. The depths of the human experience are expressed through the artwork. Computational logic is not capable of mimicking the embodied human experience. Artificial intelligence can at best be a brush in the human hand, used to express the underlying complexities of the individual and social experience. Everybody remembers the man that created the first camera, but only a few historians know the camera model that captured the first photograph. Most cubist art will be associated with Picasso, but the types of his brushes remain unknown.",0

"TOPIC: A photographer’s camera begins to develop images from places she’s never visited—and people she fears.

ANSWER: Elena pressed the shutter, expecting a familiar click and whir. But when she pulled hte latest batch of prints from the chemical bath, her hands trembled. The photographs weren’t of the misty local forests or bustling city corners she wandered daily. Instead, black-and-white landscapes sprawled before her: an abandoned lighthouse battered by foreign seas, a crumbling estate lit by a waning moon, a street she’d only seen in nightmares. Worse, at the heart of each image, figures lurked—faces she recognized from childhood fears and whospered family secrets. There was her uncle, eyes hollow, lost decades ago; a woman with a scar tracing her cheek, who haunted Elena’s dreams; and a man in a dak suit, always standing just out of focus. With every new roll of film, the images grew sharper, the figures closer. Elena realized her camera was no longer a tool for capturing the world—it was a window onto something that wanted to find her.",1

"TOPIC: Main character heads out to fields to work only to witness a terrible firestorm

ANSWER: Leaden skies greeted Sasha as she stepped from the hovel she shared with her grandmother. She sniffed once, twice. Rain would soon come. With a sigh, Sasha moved slowly into the small yard, heading towards the small shed where the tools were kept. It was the same monotonous pattern each day; weed the beds, gather what meager vegetables grew there, gather the eggs from the hens, bake the bread, do the washing, and if there was extra time, make candles to sell at market. Once outside the shed, however, Sasha's nose picked up a new scent. Smoke. It wasn't unusual to smell smoke. Farmers often burned refuse or moldy hay, but almost always in the afternoon when the dew had disappeared from the tall grass. They never burned first thing in the morning. Her brow furrowed as she cast her eyes about. Then, without warning, a wall of flame rushed down the road just before the hovel, looking as if it were headed for the castle town. With a shriek, Sasha rushed back to the door, dropping the pitchfork in her haste. ""What ails you, child?"" snapped her grandmother from her perch by the hearth. Sasha didn't answer as she watched the wall of flames proceed down the road, whipping itself into a cyclone as it went, and charring the timbers of their small gate. ""There...there's a fire mage nearby,"" Sasha murmured at last. ""And whoever it is must be angry.""",0

"TOPIC: I contain multitudes - a monologue about self ideation

ANSWER: I look back at my life and i find it very intriguing how it seems like, after two and half decades on this rock, i have failed to make any measurable impact. A few days ago i was approached by a beggar, i took what was left in my pocket and handed it to her, then a realization struck me! The moment she decided to approach me, cosmically, everything that comes off that encounter is enough to change the entire path of both our lives, This eureka made me go down the rabbit hole of trying to conceptualize the amount of butterfly effects I've caused by merely existing, maybe i am more impactful than i let on, maybe i am more than cosmically irrelevant, maybe my existence alone has a measurable effect on the outcome of the lives of thousands of people. that thought gave me hope,",0

"TOPIC: An orphan raised in a traveling circus learns the animals are hiding a centuries-old secret about the troupe.

ANSWER: Every night, as the audience’s laughter faded and the tents glowed with lantern light, Clara wandered past the animal enclosures. She’d always felt a kinship with the circus creatures—especially with old Maharaja, the tiger who watched her with sad, golden eyes. One evening, when moonlight spilled silver on the straw, Clara heard a voice—a low, rumbling whisper. “You are ready,” it said. Heart pounding, she realized it came from Maharaja himself. He told her of a pact,e sealed centuries ago, binding the animals and the circus folk together. In exchange for protection on their endless travels, the troupe’s ancestors had promised to keep the animals’ secret: at midnight, when no human watched, the animals shed their skins and danced as people once more. Clara’s orphaned heart swwelled with wonder and longing. Now, she too was part of the secret—a bridge between worlds, and perhaps, the key to breaking the ancient spell.",1
"TOPIC: The Art Market in 2025

ANSWER: The art market may seem turbulent in 2025. As tech stocks falter, mistrust in the stock market grows in the shadow of the Trump administration's erratic policies, and tariffs weaken the dollar as global financiers no longer view the dollar as a safe haven, it seems like a general bearish mood will dampen art sales and hurt the value of works on the market today. Yet, things are not entirely how they seem, and we must remind ourselves of the last time the US found itself in precarious and changing market conditions: the 2020 pandemic. While people struggled, those with the capital to afford art and a number of other luxury items like homes were able to strengthen their positions by investing in art. Indeed, the art market grew and reminded us of art's strong position as an investment option. Today, while inflation beleaguers almost every American whose wellbeing depends on their next pay check, those with capital at their on hand benefit from an increase in tax breaks leaving more money at their disposal for art purchases and investments. Indeed, by skipping backwards an election cycle, we have found ourselves in an economic environment where conditions feel uncertain for most, but for those who can foot the bill, art's attraction as a stable investment will keep the market strong as those who can afford big ticket items find themselves protected by economic policy.",0

"TOPIC: Film criticism, movie reviews, history, trivia

ANSWER: It might not be a popular ""opinion"" to call 'Star Wars' an anti-war film, but as a matter of fact, it is. Its creator and director, George Lucas, has said many times over that his series was inspired by the Vietnam War, and his Empire villains were based on America's antagonistic pursuit. This, for many, is a troublesome perspective. An inconvenient truth, actually. Take Episode IV, 'A New Hope' as an example. Released in 1977, the first released entry in the franchise features its hero's journey through the vision of a young and fiesty kid, Luke Skywalker, who enthusiastically wishes to leave home and have a life of action. In a passage that most forget, Luke wishes to sign up for the Empire in some capacity, as that is the main service available. His heart, however, is with helping the oppressed, and ultimately, through a renegade mission that he falls into, will find his place with the rebellion. One scene in particular struck me as being of particular note. When Luke and his new friends, Princess Leia and Han Solo, escape a power station known as the Death Star, they are subsequently pursued by fighter ships. Without hesitation, Luke and Han arm themselves with their weapons and begin firing as much ammunition as possible. They escape successfully and are happy to have done so, even if by taking lives. How does this relate to Vietnam? What are the implications of the scene? If Luke and Han are the rebellion, that would mean they are ""against"" the Empire, aka America. This being a film of heroes and villains, we - the audience - are meant and encouraged to root for victory over fascism and power. What happens when the country you live in is represented as a ""bad guy?"" What thoughts will come of it? Will all things be considered? Don't let the darkside of the force fool you, and there are many arguments to be made from 'Star Wars.' Difficult indeed, and challenging. But important.",0
